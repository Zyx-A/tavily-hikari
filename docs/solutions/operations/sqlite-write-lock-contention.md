# SQLite write-lock contention

## Current containment contract

- Maintenance and reconciliation state transitions use one bounded immediate transaction; related circuit fields are updated atomically rather than as independent meta writes.
- Online HA GC claims one eligible channel at a time. A deferred channel's `next_retry_at` cannot become a global scheduler delay for other channels.
- Treat `ha_outbox_gc_channel_state` as the scheduling truth, not a diagnostic mirror. The
  controller must atomically fence a channel claim, persist that channel's defer and compute the
  earliest eligible wake across all channels; a scheduler must never infer controller state from a
  log message or a single representative job's delay.
- A zero pending mask is a completed observation rather than a permanent empty-outbox assertion.
  Use a low-frequency, bounded controller-state observation-age read to rearm a fresh indexed
  channel probe; never turn the watchdog itself into an outbox scan or a special writer bypass.
- If a SQLite writer blocks the atomic HA job finish/continuation handoff, do not spawn a background retry
  loop. Keep the claim fenced and let the durable stale reaper recover it once after the threshold; this
  avoids a hidden writer-pressure task while preserving the continuation.
- Startup schema work is ledgered in `schema_migrations`; a warm process verifies the critical layout and skips already-applied DDL.
- Administrator peer status reads an observation cache. A normal GET never waits for the five-second peer network probe.
- A transport or semantic reconciliation failure does not clear an existing upstream-429 circuit. Only a real settlement or a real remote attempt follows the recovery contract.
- Transport observations are persisted as fixed, redacted categories with their observation time.
  Later non-transport runs preserve that diagnostic while retryable state remains independent;
  only a terminal compare/active result clears the retryable outcome.
- An administrator mutation is foreground work when the HTTP request itself is its only durable
  command. Route its acquire and immediate transaction through a dedicated runtime operation with
  a short total retry window. On exhausted SQLite contention, return a retryable response instead
  of inheriting the pool or connection's five-second default wait; a single-key create uses
  `503 Retry-After: 1`, while a batch keeps its explicit per-item failure result. Never pretend the
  mutation was accepted.
- Derived pressure rebuilds are hysteretic and source-fenced. A transient deferred flush is not a
  rebuild trigger; overflow, coverage loss, or five minutes of stale state starts at most one
  bounded rebuild generation every five minutes.
- Each reconciliation preparation source read needs its own native SQLite deadline, not future
  cancellation. Keep control metadata out of those sessions; install a progress handler on the
  scoped connection for candidate lanes, both hydrate kinds, Research, and historical projection,
  remove it before pool return, and close the physical connection when cleanup cannot be confirmed.
  The deadline is a typed defer before any later preparation, merge transaction, cursor advance, or
  remote request.
- Report SQLite `CACHE_WRITE` pages from the operation connection separately from process/cgroup
  write-byte deltas. The latter are aggregate pressure evidence, not query attribution.
- Keep Research source reads in a separate durable drain, bounded by the covering due index and a
  stable keyset page. Commit the single processed outcome, exact cursor, optional Key cooldown, and
  claim fence together; pressure or cancellation leaves all of them retryable. Apply dynamic
  eligibility before the page limit and force a stable-start sweep every five minutes, with the
  accepted wrap and sweep clock committed together, so bounded keyset progress does not strand rows
  that become eligible behind the cursor.
- Treat `foreground_rps` as an instance-local request-rate heuristic, not evidence of SQLite or
  host pressure. A normal Research drain yields above the threshold, but after 120 eligible seconds
  it may take one aged automatic request turn. That exception never skips the native SQLite read
  deadline, request-scoped single lease, five-second rate limit, or claim-fenced commit. If the
  lease is busy, persist a five-second `remote_lease` continuation instead of waiting inside the
  remote budget; read and control defers retain their separate 30-second continuations. Preserve
  the Research queue-time fairness anchor across those no-request defers so the 120-second age is
  not reset by every continuation; accepted polls and Key cooldowns start a new interval. After the
  lease defer's continuation is accepted, retain its aged request reservation until Research begins
  HTTP; otherwise a newly released lease lets ordinary automatic work recreate the starvation loop.
  Continue to allow their local preparation, but make them wait at the request lease itself.
- Multi-key reconciliation observation writes are short `ReconciliationProjection` transactions.
  They upsert only successful responses for the current work generation, while the two-request cap is
  represented as a typed `remote_attempt_budget` defer. Derived rows are cleared only with terminal
  completion, so writer contention cannot turn a partial remote sample into semantic failure or lose
  billing truth.

## Context

Tavily Hikari uses one SQLite database for billing ledgers, session affinity, scheduled job logs,
OAuth account state, quota sync samples, and admin/read models. WAL mode allows readers and one
writer to coexist, but only one writer can hold the write slot at a time.

## Symptoms

- Logs contain `database is locked` while `/health` remains OK.
- Request-path messages mention `token billing lock failed` or `mcp session ... lock failed`.
- Background messages mention `token-usage-rollup: start job error`, `quota-sync-hot: start job error`, or LinuxDo OAuth upsert failures.
- Startup logs may show `forward-proxy startup: ...` phases taking a long time when runtime
  snapshot persistence or subscription refresh collides with another writer.
- Deploy health may remain `starting` when restart waits for remote subscription refresh before
  restoring previously working subscription-backed proxy nodes from the local runtime table.
- WAL can be large without itself proving corruption; it is a signal to inspect writer pressure and
  long readers before performing maintenance.

## Root Cause

Short-lived SQLite writer collisions can happen when request-path billing/session locks and
background writes all touch the same DB. Treating every transient busy/locked response as fatal makes
brief contention visible as HTTP 500s or failed background bookkeeping.

On `2026-06-22`, one production sample provided a clean example of this shape: `/health` and
`/api/version` stayed fast, but the latest sampled hour still contained `34`
`database is locked` errors and `296` slow statements, concentrated around
`record_pending_billing_attempt failed for /mcp`, `request stats persist`, and a retained-log
month-tail public metrics scan.

## Resolution

- Add a runtime DB logging contract before changing lock semantics again. For this service, default
  runtime logging to JSON lines on stderr via `tracing`, and keep a documented `text` fallback for
  grep-oriented local workflows. Runtime DB phases must still emit stable fields for
  `component=db`, `event=operation_slow|operation_error`, `operation`, `elapsed_ms`, optional
  `context`, and optional `err`.
- Extend that same default runtime logging contract to the HA replication path. Baseline/events
  export/import and standby sync should emit stable `component=ha event=...` perf records with
  `elapsed_ms`, `channel`, `row_count`, `payload_bytes`, optional `compressed_bytes`, and runtime
  memory headroom fields. Do not require a second metrics pipeline just to answer “which HA leg is
  holding memory right now?”
- Enable SQL-level slow statement logging directly on runtime `sqlx` SQLite connect options, but
  keep complete statements at DEBUG. The default threshold is `250ms` for SQL statements and `1s`
  for explicit DB operation phases such as startup pool open, schema init, request-stats flush,
  scheduler enqueue, OAuth upsert, and pending billing settlement. Operators can opt into raw SQL
  with `RUST_LOG=sqlx::query=debug` without making statement text normal WARN noise.
- Keep stable startup/runtime event names so operators can tell whether the time went into pool
  open, observability attach probing, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, schema bootstrap, or a later
  request/worker write path. In JSON mode this comes from structured `component/event/...` fields;
  in fallback text mode the same fields remain grep-friendly.
- Keep billing and MCP serialization fail-closed, but retry transient SQLite busy/locked writes
  inside the existing bounded lock wait or lease budget.
- Treat online request-log retention as bulk work. Check admission before acquiring a connection;
  if the earliest eligible local day is not sealed, retain raw rows and their derived rollups,
  record one deferred outcome, and leave the durable five-minute continuation to retry later.
  Repeating a blocked batch only amplifies the writer pressure that the guard is meant to contain.
- Retry background job bookkeeping writes before surfacing scheduler errors.
- Retry OAuth upsert/refresh wrapper calls so login/profile sync can survive short writer collisions.
- Retry forward-proxy runtime snapshot persistence at the startup/maintenance boundary so a short
  writer collision does not stretch readiness.
- Overlap startup subscription fetches where possible, but keep the refresh fail-closed if every
  feed fails.
- Restore safely attributable persisted subscription-backed proxy nodes from `forward_proxy_runtime`
  before attempting remote subscription refresh. If that restored graph exists, use it for startup
  readiness and leave remote subscription calibration to the maintenance scheduler.
- Keep serving `/health` stricter than internal startup grace. If core serving traffic still
  depends on forward-proxy runtime or shared xray readiness, return non-`200` immediately instead
  of masking that gap with a grace-period green state; preserve any explicit HA standby/recovery
  minimal-health carve-out separately.
- If a derived observability rebuild is not core truth, do not keep it on the startup critical
  path. Trigger it once after the listener is already serving, trigger it again when a later HA
  promotion turns the node back into a business-serving role, keep failure isolated to logs or
  stale/empty analysis views, and cancel or roll back the rebuild if the node is demoted before it
  commits.
- If strict cold startup still depends on subscription-backed forward-proxy runtime, do not let a
  small configured subscription set spill into fixed-size timeout batches before readiness. Fan the
  whole startup set out in one wave, and keep the fail-closed rule tied to “every subscription
  fetch failed” rather than to a per-batch wall-clock artifact.
- Align deploy health timing with that stricter contract. In this service the accepted image
  baseline is `start-period=20s`, `interval=5s`, `timeout=5s`, and `retries=18`, but the
  healthcheck command itself should probe only the strict `/health` endpoint. If the service is
  truly ready, container healthy should flip on that first successful strict probe instead of
  waiting behind an extra fixed delay.
- Keep retention cleanup bounded. Large `request_logs` backlogs should be deleted in small batches
  with a runtime/batch budget and a catch-up delay, rather than one daily job holding or repeatedly
  contesting the writer until the whole backlog is gone.
- When catch-up is needed, prefer one bounded cleanup pass per `scheduled_jobs` row. Finish the
  job after the pass, record the bounded-pass totals in the message, and let the scheduler claim a
  fresh job after the recheck delay. Do not keep one `running` job row open while sleeping between
  catch-up windows.
- Keep scheduled-job trigger provenance separate from logical job type. Use a dedicated
  `trigger_source` column for scheduler/manual/auto runs so filters, duplicate detection, and
  history remain stable as operators gain manual trigger buttons.
- When DB-backed maintenance work starts contending with request-path writes, do not make
  owner-facing manual operations fight for the same execution gate. Persist maintenance jobs as
  `queued`, coalesce duplicate logical work onto one representative row, and let one maintenance
  worker consume that queue.
- If a later manual trigger attaches to an already active representative row, surface that fact
  explicitly. Promoting the representative `trigger_source` and returning `status/coalesced` hints
  keeps the admin UI from falsely implying that a new job was rejected or silently ignored.
- When a later trigger can reuse an already active representative row without changing its
  priority/source, do that coalescing through a read-only fast path. Requiring `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
  before checking the active row turns harmless duplicate manual triggers into transient HTTP 500s
  whenever a bounded GC slice is holding SQLite's writer slot.
- Treat a failed foreground admission differently from a failed durable command. HA outbox GC is
  self-scheduling recovery debt, but a manual endpoint must not report acceptance without a durable
  representative: after its bounded `250ms` foreground pool budget expires, return `503`, log the
  typed contention reason, and let the controller/watchdog re-establish automatic debt recovery.
  Do not use a synthetic job id or apply this exception to manual operations whose request itself is
  the only durable command.
- Derived observability must not use foreground synchronous writes as a shortcut. Coalesce a bounded
  pressure delta queue and persist it through one low-priority `SqliteRuntime` operation; when it
  overflows or remains deferred, mark coverage stale and rebuild from request logs. For a bounded
  rebalance audit queue, drop only the audit with explicit stale coverage, never the completed MCP
  response or the underlying business result.
- Keep admission budgets separate from SQLite connection configuration. A short maintenance budget
  is an operation deadline around pool acquisition and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, not a per-connection
  `PRAGMA busy_timeout` rewrite. Rewriting that pragma turns ordinary transient bulk pressure into
  new final lock errors for unrelated control work.
- A deferred derived-write batch must atomically return its entire uncommitted logical delta to its
  in-memory coalescer before releasing admission. Report this as a typed defer and retry on the
  next admitted cadence; do not emit an exhaustion warning for every pressure cycle.
- Never apply that defer by timing out a future that is awaiting an already-started owned
  transaction. The coalescer may requeue only after runtime-owned rollback or failure before
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; an in-flight owned commit must settle first, otherwise the same delta can be
  durably applied and then scheduled again.
- A request-stats coalescer may probe a released writer at its next nominal wake with one permit
  and a short transaction budget. Its exact delta restore makes this safe; it does not relax the
  contention cooldown for GC, rebuild, or reconciliation projection.
- Do not let request-stats backlog size bypass that nominal wake. Under foreground load, one
  admitted wake commits at most one minimum logical-key transaction, returns its tail atomically,
  and waits for the next cadence. A shutdown drain may use its separate bounded deadline to finish
  the remaining work without making the ordinary request path share a continuous writer lease.
- Apply that same reuse rule explicitly to compare-only reconciliation scheduling. `upstream_reconciliation`
  should reuse an equivalent queued/running representative row before entering the write path, and
  it should emit stable `component=reconciliation event=enqueue_reused|enqueue_exhausted` logs plus
  status-page timestamps so operators can tell “writer contention prevented a new enqueue” apart
  from “the worker is already draining the backlog”.
- Do not mistake successful enqueue reuse for successful backlog drainage. If the reconciliation
  worker repeatedly hits the same upstream key's `429` or local usage-query throttle, propagate one
  key-scoped backoff to the due windows for that key and keep other keys eligible, otherwise the
  scheduler can look healthy while the first candidate page never advances.
- Keep `queued_at` separate from `started_at`. A queued job has been accepted but has not entered a
  DB execution window yet; collapsing those timestamps makes queue delay invisible and breaks admin
  diagnosis.
- Persist an `available_at` timestamp as well. Automatic catch-up continuations need a durable
  delay across process recreation, and queue order must age old non-manual work toward a bounded
  priority floor so one fresh continuation family cannot starve HA cleanup forever. Manual triggers
  should reuse and unlock their representative job immediately. Startup cleanup must retain that
  delayed automatic continuation while abandoning unrelated stale queued/running work.
- For request-log body GC, build the selective `(created_at, id)` partial cursor index after ready
  through the maintenance queue, then cache per-user retention context for the bounded pass. This
  changes retention lookup work from candidate-row-shaped to unique-user-shaped while retaining the
  existing deletion policy.
- Treat SQLite file shrinkage as a separate maintenance concern. Row deletes and body nulling create
  free pages; size convergence requires freelist telemetry plus a controlled compaction job after
  retention cleanup has made space reclaimable.
- Serialize DB-backed scheduled/manual maintenance jobs through one persisted queue plus one
  in-process worker. Same-job duplicate claiming alone is not enough when different logical jobs,
  such as retention GC, quota sync, rollups, and compaction, can all compete for the single writer
  slot.
- Keep hot-path billing subject serialization in-process for the single-process deployment model.
  Using a SQLite lock table for every request turns one writer-slot collision into a write-amplified
  failure mode.
- Split billing truth from request history. `billing_ledger` should carry the synchronous pending /
  charged state, while `auth_token_logs` remains the legacy history surface that is mirrored for
  compatibility.
- Batch request-derived rollups. `request_logs` should write synchronously, but dashboard/API-key
  usage, auth-token activity counters, account request-rate buckets, and catalog rollups should be
  coalesced and flushed in bounded windows instead of being updated per request.
- If those observability-heavy tables move into an attached sidecar SQLite file, treat them as
  rebuildable/eventually consistent views rather than HA-trigger-replicated truth. SQLite attached
  database triggers cannot safely write back into `main`, so the HA outbox should stay focused on
  core control-plane and billing truth tables.
- Do not reuse one HA whitelist for both baseline export and change-event triggers. In this codebase
  that caused `billing_ledger` and runtime quota tables to bloat `ha_outbox` even in effectively
  single-node production. Keep HA channels explicit: `control` small-state, `billing` dedicated
  ledger truth, and `runtime` minimal correctness state.
- For control-channel cursor validation, match the SQLite index to the actual predicate shape.
  This service validates `SELECT MIN(seq) ... WHERE created_at >= ? AND resource IN (...)`; the
  plain `(created_at, seq)` index is not enough once retained backlog grows. Keep a
  `(resource, created_at, seq)` index and a query-plan regression test so the planner does not
  fall back to scanning by time and filtering resources row-by-row.
- Do not stop at splitting HA channels if the replication path still materializes a whole baseline
  or whole event batch in memory. In this service the next failure mode after channel split was a
  billing baseline path that still built one giant NDJSON string on the active node and one giant
  decompressed blob on the standby node. The reusable rule is: state-replication paths must stream
  rows/events end-to-end and apply incrementally within a bounded transaction.
- The same role gate must cover background writers, not just external request handlers. In this
  service, standby still looked “fenced” from the outside while `quota_sync`, usage rollups, GC,
  and maintenance schedulers were quietly enqueueing and writing into SQLite. That is enough to
  break a long-running HA apply transaction even when the request path is fully blocked.
- When diagnosing memory growth alongside lock pressure, report cgroup memory and process RSS/HWM
  together. On 101 the observed shape was `memory_current_bytes` near `3GB` while
  `process_rss_bytes` stayed around `560MB`; that is evidence to first reduce dashboard/HA/SQLite
  read-write amplification before calling it a heap leak.
- If HA sync persists node-state or watermark metadata through a coalescing writer, flush that
  metadata at safe boundaries between channel apply sessions. Waiting until the end of the whole
  sync loop can make the next channel's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` collide with delayed bookkeeping writes
  and surface as nested-transaction or `database is locked` failures.
- If an authority/health refresh loop keeps re-emitting the exact same HA node-state payload, do
  not let that become a periodic SQLite rewrite. In this service, a standby node whose EdgeOne
  authority stayed unchanged could still enqueue the same `ha_node_state` row every five seconds;
  deduplicating identical coalesced snapshots removed both the slow-statement noise and an
  otherwise needless writer competitor.
- Apply the same edge-trigger rule to post-ready derived work. If a writable HA status refresh
  repeats every few seconds, it must not rerun best-effort rebuild/backfill tasks that scan
  retained request logs; run them once for the writable tenure, suppress repeated refreshes with a
  low-frequency decision log, and re-arm only after the node leaves writable and later returns.
- Keep `HA_MODE=single` truly silent for HA replication writes. Leaving replication triggers enabled
  on a single live node creates unbounded local-only backlog with no standby consumer.
- Treat large retained HA event cleanup like request-log cleanup: bounded online GC for freshness,
  explicit offline one-shot cleanup for backlog removal, and optional later compaction only when
  reclaimable bytes justify it.
- Make online HA outbox cleanup a per-channel debt controller rather than a fixed-delay loop.
  Persist the current batch, deletion total, high watermark, ingress sequence delta, and estimated
  net-row delta. When the slowest active database micro-batch stays inside the small slice budget, a short continuation
  is safe enough to drain retention debt; when it exceeds the budget or the writer is busy, shrink
  and defer. Keep legacy-resource verification on a much slower cursor cadence, because treating a
  scan of valid rows as urgent backlog turns a clean large table into continuous maintenance load.
  Measure only cleanup batches for adaptive timing; post-slice state probes are diagnostics, not
  evidence that a write micro-batch exceeded budget. Keep an hourly baseline sweep for newly
  expired rows, and gate a low-frequency watchdog on durable pending-channel debt so it rediscovers
  a lost continuation without creating clean-state jobs. Add stale observed and unobserved channels to the
  current fair probe set so one busy or delayed channel cannot hide another channel's recovery debt; persist
  a pending bit only after that probe confirms work, so empty discovery cannot create a fast wake loop.
- Sequence high-watermark deltas are useful low-cost evidence of drainage versus ingress, but they
  are estimates, not exact row counts. If historical exact counts were not sampled, report the
  oldest retained age moving forward as proof of partial cleanup only; do not claim that total
  backlog rows decreased without a comparable measurement.
- Avoid exact outbox inventory on HA export/sync sampling. Read the oldest `(created_at, seq)` row
  through the retention index and pair it with the high watermark to publish a clearly named
  sequence-span estimate. Sequence holes make it an upper bound suitable for trend diagnosis, not
  a deletion decision.
- For upgraded HA databases, treat trigger repair as a separate first-class maintenance step.
  If legacy `trg_ha_outbox_*` triggers from the old single-channel era remain in `sqlite_master`,
  online GC will never catch up because the live node keeps appending fresh non-control noise into
  `ha_outbox`. Repair the trigger set first, then start backlog cleanup.
- When offline maintenance proof depends on a production-derived SQLite copy, define the input as a
  full DB set instead of a single file. In this service that means the core DB plus the
  observability sibling sidecar; copying only `tavily_proxy.db` would miss the attached
  request-log/read-model layout that production actually serves.
- Once observability tables move into a sidecar, test helpers and admin/read paths must become
  sidecar-aware too. Unqualified schema probes or direct core-only SQLite opens can silently stop
  covering `request_logs` even though production still reads that table through the attached
  `observability` database.
- If a legacy DB is large enough that inline sidecar migration would blow the startup budget, do
  not force that copy in the readiness path. Keep `observability` attached to the core DB for that
  startup/maintenance session, and let offline GC or later explicit migration handle the backlog.
- That large-legacy compatibility path should not also collapse the SQLite pool to a single
  connection. Doing both at once makes owner-facing summary flushes and early scheduler enqueues
  contend for one slot, so `/health` may go green while `/api/summary` still returns transient
  500s.
- Keep startup repairs explicitly partitioned by readiness contract. In this service,
  `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild is a post-ready best-effort analysis view and belongs in a
  one-shot background task, while `user_business_calls_1h` history rehydration is an owner-facing
  startup summary and should be restored cheaply before strict readiness turns green.
- For legacy one-time startup rewrites such as request-log effect-bucket migration, add a durable
  completion marker plus a cheap indexed precheck, and commit the rewrite together with that marker
  in one transaction. Re-running the same full-table `UPDATE` every restart wastes SQLite write
  budget even when the database is already clean, while a non-atomic marker leaves partial-restart
  ambiguity behind.
- When both `main.request_logs` and `observability.request_logs` can coexist temporarily, schema
  probes must target the attached schema explicitly. Generic `pragma_table_info('request_logs')`
  lookups can resolve against the wrong DB and trigger duplicate-column repairs.
- Owner-facing log pages that rely on coalesced catalog rollups should flush or rebuild those
  rollups before serving totals/facets. Otherwise the sidecar split removes write pressure from the
  hot path, but leaves `/api/logs` vulnerable to showing empty totals while raw `request_logs` rows
  are still present.
- After moving synchronous billing truth into `billing_ledger`, any admin history query that joins
  `auth_token_logs` to billing state must qualify legacy-table columns explicitly and avoid
  unnecessary joins in count/facet queries. Mixed ledger/history reads otherwise regress into
  `ambiguous column name` failures under ordinary owner-facing token-log filters.
- For maintenance jobs that mix remote I/O with SQLite writes, split those phases. Remote fetches
  such as forward-proxy GEO refresh or quota `/usage` probes should not hold the SQLite-writing
  execution gate, and they should not pin the queue worker when the remaining DB phase can be
  resumed separately. At the same time, do not “solve” that by fan-out spawning every remote job:
  keep a bounded actual-request remote lease so the queue cannot turn a backlog into an upstream
  stampede; local preparation and finalization must release it.
- Bound scheduler queue reads as maintenance control too. If a remote-heavy candidate page is blocked
  by the actual request lease, make one indexed local-only fallback selection before yielding so
  remote work
  cannot create queue-head blocking for local HA recovery.
- Keep `quota_sync` bounded. `/usage` fetches should have a hard timeout, the whole sync run should
  finish on a short wall-clock budget, and stale `quota_sync` / `quota_sync/hot` `running` rows
  should be abandoned during the next claim instead of waiting for a restart.
- Do not hold that job execution gate while a catch-up scheduler is sleeping between cleanup
  windows. Hold it for the active DB write window, then release it before throttled rechecks.
- Provide a one-shot operational CLI for retention cleanup so production-derived database samples
  can be tested deterministically. Do not rely only on the daily scheduler when validating cleanup
  behavior.
- Provide the same offline path for compaction. Manual HTTP trigger endpoints are still useful, but
  operators need a `db_compaction_once`-style bypass for maintenance windows when the online job
  gate is busy.
- For HA maintenance windows, the safe order is `ha_trigger_repair_once` (or
  `ha_outbox_cleanup_once --repair-triggers`) first, `ha_outbox_cleanup_once` second, and
  `db_compaction_once` optional third. Reversing that order can leave the live node still writing
  invalid backlog, or vacuum retained dead rows too early and waste I/O without reclaiming the real
  problem.
- If the live system stores the main DB and observability data in sibling SQLite files, export the
  offline validation input with SQLite `.backup` per file and carry forward SHA-256 plus
  `PRAGMA integrity_check` evidence for each member of the set.
- For hot WAL-mode production databases, prefer a single-step backup for offline export instead of
  small incremental page loops. SQLite's incremental backup API can restart when the live source is
  modified underneath it; on a busy writer this can turn a snapshot export into an apparent
  livelock. Use page-level progress reporting for observability, but default the real export path
  to one single-step copy.
- If the snapshot export path stages large temporary backup files on the source host, treat cleanup
  of those staging directories as part of the same maintenance runbook. A successful upload to the
  shared testbox is not the end of the flow if tens of GiB remain under a temporary source path.
- Treat online snapshots as sensitive production data: use `umask 077`, fail on run-directory
  collisions, verify source and destination capacity, bound each backup, expose the live volume
  read-only to a network-disabled helper, and clean only the exact owned source/testbox paths on
  failure or completion.
- Treat disk hygiene as an explicit post-maintenance step. Remove orphaned one-off snapshot
  directories, stale gzip/sqlite artifacts, and dangling images once the new release is verified, or
  the next “database is too large” incident can be self-inflicted by leftover maintenance inputs
  rather than live product data.
- Avoid high-resource retention catch-up tactics such as rebuilding large log tables or producing a
  large WAL. If the backlog is very large, run repeated bounded cleanup windows and verify progress
  with row counts and resource telemetry.
- Keep startup backfills cheap and no-op aware. Large production SQLite files make repeated per-user
  repair loops expensive even when every row is already correct; use an indexed precheck in the
  readiness path and move periodic refresh work to a background scheduler.
- A background rebuild is not low priority merely because it starts after readiness. Never acquire
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` before a long analytical aggregation: capture an immutable upper bound, compute
  the projection through read connections, then acquire the writer only for the bounded replacement
  and replay buffered tail events. Otherwise one observability rebuild can stall billing, job claims,
  and unrelated backfills for the full scan duration.
- The read/write split creates two event-boundary races unless a transition gate owns the handoff. A
  direct incremental write that observed inactive must finish before the rebuild captures its upper
  bound; after bucket replacement, detach the buffered tail and switch to replaying mode while
  holding the buffer gate, then replay that finite snapshot in yielding batches. New events return
  directly to persistence, so sustained ingress cannot grow the tail indefinitely or permit an
  overlapping rebuild.
- For `billing_ledger` startup truth repair specifically, persist a high-watermark marker and let
  the readiness path prove “no gap / no drift” before invoking a whole-ledger reconcile. The first
  upgraded boot may still need one repair, but steady-state restarts should only pay the precheck.
- If an owner-facing read can tolerate durable rollups, never flush the coalescer from that read.
  A short read-side write budget still converts read traffic into writer contention; expose pending
  state through internal freshness and let the background pipeline persist on its own cadence.
- Do not let an SSE freshness poll become that write barrier by accident. In this service,
  `/api/events` was polling every 2 seconds; when its freshness path called the same
  `summary_windows` / rollup-flush helpers as the dashboard rebuild, it re-heated SQLite write
  contention even before a human opened a heavier admin page. Keep the poll path on cheap
  no-flush reads plus pending-coalescer signatures, and reserve the actual flush for the shared
  snapshot rebuild that will be emitted to clients.
- When request-path billing needs both a history row and a ledger row, keep them in one SQLite
  transaction before adding retries. Retrying two independent writes can duplicate the history row
  and only masks the actual contention bug.
- For request-path and flush contention, expose one stable structured retry/exhaustion contract:
  `operation`, `request_path`, `request_kind`, `attempt|attempts`, `backoff_ms`, `elapsed_ms`,
  `retry_budget_ms`, `pending_batch_counts`, `oldest_pending_created_at`,
  `newest_pending_created_at`, and `billing_subject_kind`. Use `token|account|unknown` only; never
  log raw billing subjects, token secrets, or request bodies.
- If public metrics only need success counts, do not reuse a generic retained-log summary scan for a
  month-tail fallback. Subtract the retained tail from the last daily rollup bucket with a bounded
  success-count query instead of reintroducing a wide `WITH scoped_logs AS (...)` scan.
- Do not let lock-contention tests depend on real wall-clock sleep just to cross a retry window or a
  one-second timestamp boundary. Prefer deterministic state shaping or a controlled time seam so the
  test still exercises the production retry logic without paying real-time cost.
- Prefer bounded retries and narrower write windows before increasing SQLite pool size.
- Treat the three-connection pool as a foreground reservation, not as spare writer capacity. Keep
  two slots actually idle or immediately allocatable for request-path work; admit at most one bulk
  maintenance operation per
  `KeyStore` only after a pre-acquire check for pool capacity, low foreground arrival rate, and no
  recent SQLite contention. A rejected bulk operation must persist its typed defer without first
  entering the pool.
- Short queue metadata transactions are control work, not bulk work: give them a fixed `100ms`
  budget, bypass the bulk permit, and rely on their durable representative/stale-recovery contract
  after a transient failure. Background retry loops merely transfer contention into an unbounded
  task leak.

## Guardrails / Reuse Notes

- A raw SQLite transaction on a pooled connection needs cancellation ownership, not only an error
  branch with `ROLLBACK`. Hold the physical connection in a guard, commit or roll back explicitly,
  and detach/close it on drop while the transaction may still be open. Otherwise cancellation can
  return a transaction-polluted connection and the next borrower sees a false nested transaction.
- Enforce that ownership with a source dependency gate. Runtime transaction SQL belongs in one
  guard module; migrations, offline CLIs, and tests need explicit allowlist entries rather than an
  informal convention.
- Attribute pressure by stable operation/class windows, not raw SQL logs: aggregate pool wait, begin
  wait, fixed-bucket hold-time p95, rows, errors, discarded connections, and process/cgroup write-byte deltas at low
  frequency. Sample `/proc` and cgroup I/O only when emitting the window or a real error.
- For a historical projection, do not put source scan, aggregation, merge, and cursor movement in one
  transaction guarded by an outer timeout. Read a stable keyset micro-page first, aggregate outside
  SQLite's writer, then use one claim-fenced transaction for merge plus cursor CAS. A stale claim is
  an explicit rollback; a busy writer is a typed defer; neither should appear as a discarded connection.
- A maintenance job that releases its bulk permit before remote I/O still needs shutdown ownership.
  Use a separate non-exclusive run lease so graceful shutdown can stop new runs, skip optional tail
  work, and wait for an already-observed remote result to reach its claim-fenced finalization. Do not
  retain the scarce SQLite bulk permit while waiting on the network.
- A durable scheduler claim needs a generation as well as a status. Increment it on claim and stale
  recovery, then require `(id, generation, running)` for finish and continuation writes; this closes
  the ABA window where a timed-out future completes a newly reclaimed job.
- Continuation persistence must have one owner. Keep only the current generation's representative
  retrying at a capped cadence until it persists or stale recovery fences it; retry fan-out per
  failure amplifies writer contention, while a fixed timeout recreates a post-lock recovery gap.

- Do not enable full SQL debug logging in production by default. Slow-statement logging is enough
  for this contention class and avoids dumping every statement or bind-heavy traffic path.
- Treat runtime DB operation logs and `sqlx::query` slow warnings as complementary:
  `sqlx::query` answers “which statement was slow,” while `db operation ...` answers “which
  service-layer operation or phase was slow/failing.”
- Do not fix this class of problem by simply raising `sqlx` pool size; more concurrent writers can
  increase lock pressure.
- Do not hand-edit production ledgers. Use repository repair binaries or controlled migrations when
  historical data needs correction.
- Keep request-path quota semantics stable: locked billing subject, pending replay, quota precheck,
  and settlement must remain one coherent subject.
- For WAL growth, inspect active readers and checkpoint behavior before running live maintenance.
- Deleting rows does not shrink the SQLite file by itself. Treat VACUUM or database replacement as
  a separate maintenance-window decision after retention cleanup has completed.
- Automatic compaction should be threshold-gated and cooldown-limited. Triggering it on every GC
  pass can turn a cleanup backlog into a new writer-pressure loop.
- Do not treat a large main SQLite file as proof that the main DB alone is the whole persistence
  surface. In this project the observability sibling sidecar is part of the production-shaped input,
  while `ha_outbox` and other retained rows can make the core file look “unreasonably large” until
  retention cleanup and optional compaction are completed in the right order.
- A successful cleanup proof does not guarantee that offline compaction can run on every shared
  validation host. `VACUUM` still needs enough free filesystem headroom for the rewritten database.
  When cleanup shows multi-GiB reclaimable space but the shared validation host has only a few GiB
  left, record that as an environment-capacity blocker and reserve the actual compaction for a real
  maintenance window with adequate free space.
- Stale `scheduled_jobs.running` rows from a previous process lifetime are still an operational
  restart concern. Claim-time stale abandonment should cover fresh quota-sync wedges, but the
  broader maintenance queue should abandon every leftover `queued`/`running` row on startup instead
  of implicitly resuming unknown partial work from an old process.
- If a retention table has aggregate-maintenance triggers, validate large-copy cleanup with the
  triggers in mind. For `request_logs`, GC deletes expired rollup buckets separately and suppresses
  the per-row rollup delete trigger inside each batch transaction to avoid spending minutes per
  batch on redundant aggregate updates.
- If an owner-facing read surface depends on coalesced rollups, flush the batcher before reading
  or rebuild from source rows when a legacy/manual path bypasses the coalescer.
- For a derived rollup repair, never retain a SQLite write transaction while scanning the raw source
  table. Persist a bounded work item with a fixed source fence and `(created_at, id)` cursor, read at
  most 500 rows or 150ms per slice, then replace only the confirmed-different bucket rows in a short
  write transaction. A dense slice may carry its in-memory aggregate into the next work item, but it
  must not publish a partial replacement.
- For a live derived series such as server pressure, stage the rebuild in a new generation behind a
  fixed source fence. Publish the generation once, replay the transition-buffered tail, and delete
  old-generation rows only in 25-row cleanup slices. Normal deltas always target the active
  generation. This prevents a whole-table delete/reinsert rebuild from turning observability repair
  into sustained write amplification or exposing an empty live series.
- Treat `busy`/`locked`, a queue backlog, and a write above the 250ms slow threshold as deferral
  signals for observability repair. Record the gap, release the writer, and retry through the single
  persisted maintenance queue; do not increase the pool or compete with the request path.
- Preserve a compact, verified day-level seal before raw observability logs become eligible for
  deletion. This keeps post-retention daily rollups auditable and recoverable without extending raw
  retention or adding a wide raw-log index.
- Coordinate a source-derived replacement with an in-memory coalescer. A bounded flush alone is not
  sufficient because a request log can commit just before its additive delta is enqueued. Install a
  source-fence repair barrier before replacement: discard delayed deltas already represented by the
  source aggregate, hold post-fence deltas until the replacement commits, then requeue and re-audit
  those later changes. On any replacement failure, release every held delta normally.
- Treat an in-progress aggregate checkpoint as process-local. On startup, reset its cursor, aggregate,
  and fence instead of trusting an in-memory mutation generation that a hard stop erased. A retained
  source day whose minute total no longer matches its recovery seal must enter the same bounded
  source-backed repair queue; do not silently advance its seal cursor or unblock GC.
- Do not let a long historical audit monopolize a small maintenance worker. Finish the first hot
  window before starting history, cap historical slices at one per minute afterwards, and represent
  repeated hot checks as individual pending work items rather than reclassifying the whole hot
  window as unverified.
- Apply the same interleaving rule to retained-source sealed-day repairs: no more than one
  historical day slice per minute, and never ahead of a newly closed or initial hot slice. A source
  mutation guard that is dropped after a database update must pessimistically invalidate that
  range's generation before releasing its in-flight marker, otherwise a read that began before the
  cancellation can certify stale data.
- Gate dashboard seal retention on the oldest visible source day, not the oldest raw log row.
  Suppressed retry-shadow rows contribute no dashboard aggregates, so requiring a dashboard seal
  for a suppressed-only day can permanently stop raw-log GC without improving recoverability.

## Self-healing recovery notes

- For online HA debt recovery, sample `/api` and `/mcp` arrivals with lock-free counters rather than
  taking the global request read gate. Enter a persisted recovery mode only after 30 minutes at or
  below `5` requests per second; use a one-second continuation while the slice is productive, and
  return to 30 seconds on foreground pressure, busy writers, or slow batches. Keep one channel per
  slice and persist the round-robin cursor, oldest deletable age, deletion rate, recovery deadline,
  and SLO state.
- Fence every scheduled-job completion and continuation with a monotonically increasing claim
  generation. A stale claim is a benign internal outcome; the stale reaper, not a retry loop, owns
  recovery after atomic finish-plus-continuation persistence fails.
- Keep online request-log and HA cleanup bounded; historical backlog rate must be proven by oldest
  deletable age and measured deletion rate, not by a sequence-span estimate or an unbounded count.
- Keep reconciliation local-budget pressure separate from remote 429 pressure. Main settlement must
  start before research sweep, and normal HA GC progress should use one sampled per-channel aggregate
  INFO per minute; reserve immediate logs for slow slices, lock conflicts, and state transitions.

## Symptom Mapping

For the `2026-06-19 01:00 +08:00` onward production sample, the runtime DB log contract should map
the observed symptoms like this:

- `forward-proxy startup: sqlite initialized in 38906ms`
  -> keep the startup lifecycle event and expect
  `component=db event=operation_slow operation="sqlite startup" ...`
- `quota-sync-hot: enqueue job error: ... database is locked`
  -> expect `component=db event=operation_error operation="scheduled job enqueue" ...`
- `request stats persist warning: ... database is locked`
  -> expect `component=db event=operation_error operation="request stats persist" ...`
- `upsert linuxdo oauth account error: ... database is locked`
  -> expect `component=db event=operation_error operation="oauth account upsert" ...`
- `oauth account upsert: transient sqlite write error (...)`
  -> keep bounded retry logs and expect the final phase-level `oauth account upsert` slow/error log
- `apply_pending_billing_log: transient sqlite write error (...)`
  -> keep bounded retry logs and expect the final phase-level
  `component=db event=operation_slow|operation_error operation="apply_pending_billing_log" ...`
- request-path `/api/tavily/search` / MCP billing failures
  -> correlate request warning lines with `apply_pending_billing_log`, quota/billing lock logs, and
  `sqlx::query` warn lines for slow statements on the same wall-clock window
- Keep online HA cleanup on the application's already-open pool. Use a dedicated non-blocking GC
  lease rather than a gate shared with the full HTTP request lifetime, pin one persisted channel to
  a connection with a short SQLite busy timeout, and finish plus requeue after 30 seconds when the
  lease or writer is unavailable. Do not checkpoint WAL from the online slice. Keep the one-shot
  CLI's larger batch/time budget separate, and use its read-only `--dry-run` before approving any
  destructive maintenance window.
- Treat ACK lag as peer-relative data. A full-master export/baseline has no peer watermark and must
  report `null`, while an admin peer/channel health view can derive healthy/catching-up/baseline/
  expired-backlog state from the watermark, retention threshold, and indexed `EXISTS` checks.

## Owned short transactions and derived writes

The runtime, rather than the awaiting handler, owns a started short SQLite transaction. Cancellation
therefore resolves a rollback before returning the physical connection; detach is a protective path
only when the connection state cannot be proven. For derived pressure and audit data, batch under
one short transaction, requeue the whole uncommitted batch, debounce healthy writes, and reserve
rebuilds for overflow, coverage loss, or sustained stale state rather than ordinary contention.
