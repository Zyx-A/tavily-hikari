# PWA update activation lifecycle

## Context

A page can send an activation message to a waiting service worker without ever receiving the
`controllerchange` event it expects. Treating message delivery as completion leaves the UI in an
unbounded activating state when the worker becomes redundant, the message channel fails, or the
browser does not hand control to the current page.

Multiple registrations add another trap. A page may be controlled by a root-scope public worker
while it installs a more-specific admin worker for the first time. The presence of any controller
does not prove that the admin registration is performing an update.

## Resolution

- Treat `postMessage` as a request, not an acknowledgement of activation.
- Give every user-triggered activation a bounded watchdog and a retryable failure state.
- Accept both `controllerchange` and the target worker reaching `activated` as success signals.
- Guard reload so concurrent success signals can trigger at most one navigation.
- Treat `redundant` and synchronous message delivery errors as explicit failures.
- Determine first install versus update from the target registration's own `active` worker, not
  from `navigator.serviceWorker.controller`.
- Activate a first-install waiting worker silently. If another registration currently controls the
  page, expect the new registration to take over on the next in-scope navigation rather than
  requiring an immediate controller swap.
- Do not call `respondWith` for network-only API, MCP, SSE, authentication, or mutation requests.
  A long-lived response keeps the old worker's FetchEvent alive and can prevent the replacement
  worker from completing activation.
- Do not call `clients.claim()` from the update worker's activate event. Let first installs take
  control on the next in-scope navigation; for explicit updates, reload after the target worker
  reaches `activated` so the new navigation selects the new controller.
- Keep a contained `503` fallback only for ordinary same-origin runtime resources that the worker
  intentionally owns and that are not precached.
- Keep the manifest as the install metadata authority for supported platforms: give each identity a
  stable `id`, remove legacy `apple-touch-icon` links that can take precedence in WebKit, and put a
  content hash in every generated install-icon URL.
- Center square launcher, maskable, and monochrome exports by the visible alpha bounds of the
  approved mark, not by the transparent source canvas; otherwise source padding shifts the
  installed artwork even when the artwork itself has not changed.
- Serve HTML, manifests, workers, and version metadata with revalidation while serving content-hashed
  regular/maskable icon files as immutable assets. Keep manifests and install icons out of the
  service worker precache and cache-first path so an already-active V1 worker cannot hide V2
  installation metadata before its replacement activates. Register the worker with
  `updateViaCache: 'none'`.
- Treat existing iOS/iPadOS Web Clips and browsers without manifest metadata synchronization as a
  platform limitation. The site cannot force-migrate their installed icon, and reinstalling is not the
  normal update mechanism.

## Guardrails

- Do not auto-reload after an activation timeout; the user may have unsaved work and reload may not
  repair a worker that never activated.
- Do not hide an activation failure by returning silently to the ready state. Show a non-blocking,
  non-modal status with retry and dismiss actions.
- Test the state machine with deterministic worker mocks, then retain one real-browser two-release
  scenario that changes the service worker script on the same origin and proves controller/cache
  takeover.
- Exercise the generated worker's fetch handler to prove network-only requests never call
  `respondWith`, while owned runtime requests still convert rejected fetches into `503` responses.
- The real-browser two-release test must race successful navigation against the
  `activation-failed` banner so a stalled update fails with the same symptom users see.
