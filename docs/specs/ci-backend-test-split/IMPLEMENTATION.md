# GitHub Actions 后端测试拆分与并行提速 实现状态（#3grrf）

> 当前有效规范仍以 `./SPEC.md` 为准；这里记录实现覆盖、交付进度与 rollout 相关事实，避免这些细节散落到 PR / Git 历史里。

## Current Status

- Implementation: in progress
- Lifecycle: active
- Catalog note: CI backend lanes, checksum-addressed artifacts, and stable aggregate gate

## Coverage / rollout summary

- PR1 目标：
  - backend semantic shards
  - single-build `web/dist` artifact reuse
  - stable `Backend Tests` aggregate gate
  - `Compose Smoke` / `Build (Release)` critical-path unblock
- PR2 目标：
  - shard manifest + coverage verifier
  - lib / bin test job-matrix parallelization without reducing test count

## Implemented Now

- CI five-minute backend path
  - `Backend Shard Plan` no longer waits for `web-assets`; it creates the minimal embedded-web
    fixture, compiles all backend targets with `ci-test`, verifies coverage, uploads one backend
    bundle, and exports a sixteen-lane matrix within the fixed maximum.
  - The plan first restores an exact v2 backend bundle keyed by all compilation and sharding inputs. A hit
    skips system and Rust setup plus Cargo compilation, but still runs the existing checksum and coverage
    verifier before uploading a per-run artifact. A miss uses `target/ci-test` only as a cold-build
    dependency fallback, then saves the newly assembled exact bundle.
  - `Backend Test Lane` jobs now checkout the source tree at the default workspace path, then
    download, checksum-verify, and run a lane from the self-contained bundle. Checkout only
    satisfies tests that use the compile-time manifest directory; lanes still avoid frontend
    artifact downloads, system packages, Rust setup, Cargo cache restoration, and recompilation.
    The bundle retains its read-only source snapshot for artifact provenance and compatibility.
  - `Backend Tests` remains the stable aggregate check. The target is the native Actions interval
    from plan start to aggregate completion, with no new required performance check.
  - Unrelated heavy jobs keep their existing commands but wait for the backend aggregate, leaving
    the hosted runner concurrency available for the fixed sixteen backend lanes. This changes only
    job ordering; it does not alter release, lint, or version-layer validation semantics.
- Artifact and lane contracts
  - `ci-test` inherits `test` while disabling debug information and incremental compilation.
  - `build.rs` can consume `TAVILY_HIKARI_WEB_DIST_DIR`; CI supplies a stable minimal fixture under the
    selected profile while the normal `web/dist` fallback is unchanged.
    Repeated CI preparation does not rewrite unchanged fixture files or vary the build-script environment
    path, so a restored target cache remains Cargo-fingerprint-valid.
  - The bundle writer emits format 2 with one checksum-addressed copy per executable. Filenames
    preserve each source binary's prefix so Cargo sibling-binary resolution works without adding a
    second copy. The loader supports both formats and verifies SHA-256 before execution.
  - The scheduled duplicate-claim and reporting admitted-flush tests run as dedicated serial exact
    shards. Their parent prefixes exclude only those full test names, preserving the original coverage
    ownership while avoiding shared SQLite pool contention in two-thread filter processes.
  - The LinuxDo/forward shard excludes the dashboard overview group, which runs in its own two-thread
    semantic shard. This keeps the long dashboard process from serially extending unrelated LinuxDo checks.
  - Account and user identity coverage is divided into account/LinuxDo, user-token, user-business-call, and
    legacy-account groups. The existing serial business-call prefix remains in its own group, so it no longer
    waits behind unrelated identity filters.
  - `lib-request-rollup`, `lib-account-user`, `bin-admin-api`, and `bin-ha-rest` are split into
    mutually exclusive semantic groups. Rollup integrity, alert projection, and reconciliation
    are independent groups so measured long tails can be packed separately. Manifest estimates
    feed stable LPT lane packing.
  - Reconciliation coverage is divided into maintenance, upstream-reconciliation, and projection
    groups. Upstream reconciliation runs its 26 verified test names in independent single-thread
    processes, capped at four only when the caller requests that capacity. This prevents an
    unrelated slow test process from serializing the whole group while the coverage verifier
    continues to reject overlap or omissions.
  - Request rollup storage is divided into rollup storage, request-log retention, and scheduled
    request-maintenance groups. Admin resources are divided into identity, observability, and
    settings groups. The manifest contract tests preserve the old prefix unions, so the split can
    only alter lane placement, not test ownership.
  - The request-stats background slice test is its own serial reporting shard. The remaining
    reporting shard excludes that exact test, preventing its pool-admission workload from sharing
    a test process while preserving one manifest owner for every reporting test.
  - The admin dashboard SSE refresh test is an independent single-process, single-thread shard.
    Identity excludes that exact name, preserving one owner while preventing unrelated admin API
    filters from delaying its event deadline. Operational maintenance has a four-process cap; all
    other shards retain their explicit cap or the default of three.
  - MCP main-binary coverage is split into mutually exclusive billing, rebalance-session,
    rebalance-control, research protocol, research batch, and system groups so long semantic
    prefixes cannot share one lane tail. The protocol group runs its parent prefix with the batch
    child prefix skipped only after set-equivalence validation; both research groups and system
    retain their serial process boundaries.
  - Manifest weights are recalibrated from the maximum of repeated native shard timings with bounded
    headroom. Request-log retention is divided into GC maintenance and serial policy groups, so
    its two long prefixes are independently packed while the policy process remains serial.
    Affinity, reconciliation, LinuxDo, reporting, and server HTTP contract retain enough weight
    to keep the sixteen-lane LPT output within the 120-second lane budget after semantic splits.
  - HA lifecycle coverage is divided into mutually exclusive lifecycle, lifecycle-state base, HA-event, and
    HA-recovery groups. The event and recovery groups preserve separate test processes, so the long HA family
    cannot become one atomic lane tail.
  - `prepare-artifacts` logs compilation, test-list discovery, and bundle-staging elapsed markers.
    They make a cold-compile regression attributable without turning elapsed time into a CI gate.
    Backend artifact upload uses a lower compression level to reduce CPU time on the critical path;
    artifact metadata remains subject to the existing size budget.
- Development execution
  - `run-all`, `run-shard`, and `run-lane` accept Cargo-job, filtered-process-worker, and
    filtered-test-thread controls. The local default is `2/1/2`; `--diagnostic` is `1/1/1`.
  - Pre-commit commands now run sequentially and keep Clippy as
    `cargo clippy --locked -j 2 -- -D warnings`.

- `src/tests/mod.rs` + `src/tests/support.rs` + `src/tests/**`
  - 库内测试已从 `include!(\"chunk_*.rs\")` 机械切片切回真实语义模块，并把共享 helper 显式收敛到 `support` 层。
  - `src/tests/chunk_04_tail.rs` 已删除；observability / oauth / announcement / coalescer 等测试迁入语义模块文件。
- `src/server/tests.rs` + `src/server/tests/**`
  - server/bin 测试已从单个 `mod tests { include!(...) }` 机械聚合改为真实模块树，并通过 `core_support_and_parsing`、`upstream_support_and_manual_jobs` 等显式 support helper 保持复用关系。
- `src/server/spa.rs` + `src/server/tests/admin_token_filters_and_maintenance.rs`
  - 修复 `registration-paused.html` 在 embedded web assets 开启时误覆盖本地静态 fallback 的回归，并补上 targeted regression test，确保 shard 后的 release/build path 保持原有行为。

## Current Validation

- `python3 scripts/test_ci_backend_tests.py`: passed eighteen runner contract tests covering format 2
  checksum verification, format 1 loading, deduplicated references, portable lane runtime, stable
  LPT output, minimal web fixture, resource defaults, and the serial parent-prefix child-skip proof.
- `actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml`, `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, Markdown formatting, and
  `cargo clippy --locked -j 2 -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `cargo test --locked -j 2 --all-features --lib runtime_logging::tests::runtime_memory_helpers_parse_status_and_cgroup_values -- --exact --test-threads=2`: passed.

## Historical Evidence

The following evidence describes the earlier three-matrix topology. It remains useful for comparing
behavioral coverage, but it is not evidence for the current lane topology or five-minute objective.

- 本地 shard coverage 验证：
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py verify`
  - 结果证明当前 manifest 覆盖 `396 lib + 334 main-bin` tests，且 `bin-support` 与 5 个 integration suites 全覆盖，无 overlap、无 unmatched。
- 代表性本地 shard 复现：
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id lib-account-user`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id lib-request-rollup`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id bin-admin-api`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id bin-mcp-billing`
  - 结果表明最后几个慢 shard 主要由一串 `12-18s` 级顺序慢测试组成，而不是执行器挂死。
- build-once fanout 本地证据：
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py prepare-artifacts --output-dir /tmp/backend-test-artifacts`：当前墙钟约 `70.71s`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py verify --prebuilt-root /tmp/backend-test-artifacts`：通过
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id bin-admin-api --prebuilt-root /tmp/backend-test-artifacts`：当前墙钟约 `94.03s`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id lib-request-rollup --prebuilt-root /tmp/backend-test-artifacts`：当前稳定墙钟约 `62.95s`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id lib-core --prebuilt-root /tmp/backend-test-artifacts`：当前稳定墙钟约 `38.61s`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py run-shard --id lib-forward-proxy --prebuilt-root /tmp/backend-test-artifacts`：当前稳定墙钟约 `46.06s`
  - `python3 scripts/ci_backend_tests.py benchmark --max-workers 8`：当前稳定墙钟约 `169.35s`
- GitHub PR run 证据：
  - PR `#317` / head `a0ff34307cf8a81836bf75831ea24a6e13ad170c`
  - `CI Pipeline` run `27100670939`
  - 所有 shard、稳定 `Backend Tests` aggregate gate、`Compose Smoke (ForwardAuth + Caddy)`、`Build (Release)`、`Lint & Checks`、`Frontend Checks`、`Web Assets` 均成功。
  - PR 当前 `mergeStateStatus=CLEAN`、`mergeable=MERGEABLE`

## Remaining Gaps

- 当前 backend benchmark 已压到 `169.35s`，但单次 `cargo test --locked --all-features` 仍会串行执行 lib 与 main-bin 两大 test binary；若未来继续优化 owner 本地全量墙钟，应继续从 deterministic time 与 test binary 级别并发，而不是退回 substring runner。
