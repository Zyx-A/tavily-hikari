# Implementation

## Current Coverage

- `SqliteRuntime` now owns per-`KeyStore` foreground activity, recent contention signals, one
  bulk permit, fixed workload budgets, and a bounded workload aggregation window. Bulk admission
  is rejected before a pooled connection is obtained whenever fewer than two foreground slots
  remain, foreground activity exceeds `5 rps`, or a busy/pool-timeout occurred in the last five
  seconds.
- HA GC rechecks admission between SQL statements and records a typed 30-second defer only for
  its selected channel. Request-stats flushes use adaptive `25..250` logical-key chunks; a
  background admission commits at most four chunks within one 50ms transaction-start/next-chunk
  budget, returns the remaining unstarted tail to the coalescer exactly once, and waits for the
  next nominal second before its next slice. A started transaction reaches its runtime-owned commit
  or rollback boundary before the batch is requeued. Explicit shutdown drain paths may continue
  through further chunks within their own bounded deadline.
- Dashboard integrity and pressure rebuild use the same bulk boundary. Claim, finish,
  continuation, and stale recovery are short control transactions and do not wait on the bulk
  permit or run a background retry loop. Runtime transaction deadlines implement their short
  writer budgets without changing the configured SQLite `busy_timeout`; bulk contention returns a
  typed deferred outcome, while a control write can reuse an already durable representative row.
- Administrator alert and privacy reads are bounded operations. Alerts use the complete projection
  through the `AlertProjection` runtime connection and exact-query last-good cache; privacy status
  uses an AppState-owned immutable last-good controller and one low-priority refresh flight.
  Pressure never releases an admission check and then waits on an unbounded raw pool acquire; the
  privacy read's connection-local busy timeout returns contention without cancelling or discarding
  its connection, HTTP never cancels an open privacy read snapshot, and a cold cache returns
  retryable unavailable.
- Server-pressure deltas and rebalance audit persistence use an instance-owned deferred writer.
  Pressure batches contain at most 25 bucket keys per `ObservabilityDeferredWrite` transaction and
  return to a bounded queue after transient contention; its source-fenced rebuild remains the
  recovery path. Rebalance audit batches contain at most ten entries and remain best-effort, so
  MCP completion never waits for an observability SQLite write.
- Dashboard reads no longer make raw alert aggregation part of the HTTP/SSE path. The AppState-owned
  read model returns its immutable last-good snapshot under pressure, while a bounded
  observability-sidecar AlertProjection advances source cursors and a fence/tail replay in the
  background. The projection worker materializes a bounded recent-summary record at most once per
  sixty-second window; newer source generations mark that record stale until the next worker refresh,
  so Dashboard reads consume the record and coverage rather than running a sidecar aggregate.
  Overview-visible durable writes advance the same shared dirty generation as request
  statistics, so the ten-second rebuild cadence does not depend on the sixty-second safety probe.
  The projection keeps a recent Dashboard tail and a separate historical administrator lane: tail
  coverage must be complete before replacing last-good Dashboard data, while history may continue
  catching up in 25-event slices. Every transient SQLite acquire/read/write failure is a typed
  defer. An empty source probe returns an in-memory idle result without a cursor write; a low-rate
  heartbeat refreshes tail observation separately so no-work polling cannot create a ten-second
  writer loop. After process start it yields one short recovery window to HA GC before competing for
  the single maintenance-bulk permit.
- The administrator-history fence repair is a separate ledgered migration. It preserves recorded
  migration checksums and resets only derived history state for replayable background catch-up, so a
  boundary correction cannot scan source tables at startup or alter the Dashboard tail.

- Startup uses `schema_migrations(version,name,checksum,applied_at)` as the synchronous additive migration ledger. New databases alone run the full schema bootstrap; existing production layouts are adopted directly after complete baseline validation, without replaying legacy bootstrap DDL. Checksum drift or missing critical objects fails startup closed. Warm production startup skips registered DDL and runs only bounded semantic maintenance. Additive HA GC migrations include the per-channel legacy cursor and seed it from the former shared cursor before recording the migration, so an upgraded database preserves completed legacy-scan progress.
- Reconciliation circuit fields are committed through one cancellation-safe immediate transaction. HA GC channel completion checks its persisted claim generation before clearing the claim.
- Reconciliation historical projection no longer scans and aggregates 500 source rows while holding
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. A `25..100` row stable-keyset read is aggregated in memory, followed by one short
  claim-fenced merge/cursor-CAS transaction. Handled stale claims explicitly roll back; runtime budgets
  are checked between phases rather than cancelling an open transaction.
- Graceful shutdown marks new reconciliation-run admission closed as soon as the process receives
  its shutdown signal, then drains both the instance-owned maintenance-bulk permit and active run
  leases. A run lease remains held across remote I/O without reserving SQLite bulk admission, so an
  already-observed remote result can finish its claim-fenced write while no new research begins.
- Claimed reconciliation projection transfers that permit into its short transaction task. Caller
  cancellation drops only the join handle; the task retains admission through explicit commit or
  rollback, so it cannot expose an unfinished transaction or overlap a replacement bulk slice.
- Reconciliation source reads run under a connection-local 250ms SQLite progress-handler deadline.
  A matching interrupt is a typed deferred outcome before merge/cursor work; handler removal is
  verified before pool return and uncertainty closes the physical connection.

- Added a runtime logging contract for the online service surface based on `tracing` +
  `tracing-subscriber`. Runtime logging now defaults to JSON lines on stderr, exposes a documented
  `RUNTIME_LOG_FORMAT=text` fallback for grep-oriented workflows, and keeps `RUST_LOG` filtering
  intact. All runtime `SqliteConnectOptions` still enable `sqlx` slow statement logging at `250ms`.
- Added shared DB operation log helpers in `src/store/mod.rs`. They emit stable structured events
  with `component=db`, `event=operation_slow|operation_error`, `operation=...`,
  `elapsed_ms=...`, optional `context=...`, and optional `err=...`, so startup, request-path, and
  background DB phases can be filtered with one contract in both JSON and fallback text mode.
- Runtime DB operation logs intentionally do not include SQL bind values. The SQL-level
  `sqlx::query` slow-statement warnings keep the statement text/summary and timing, while the
  explicit phase-level helper keeps only operation/context metadata to avoid leaking secrets.
- Startup SQLite open / observability-attach probe / schema initialization now pass through that
  shared helper with a `1s` slow-operation threshold. Startup/shutdown/HA/forward-proxy paths also
  emit named runtime events (`component`, `event`, and path-specific fields), so operators can tell
  which startup DB phase stalled or failed without depending on ad hoc stderr text.
- Request-path DB work now has unified phase logs around LinuxDo OAuth upsert/profile refresh and
  pending billing settlement. That covers the same classes already seen in production after
  `2026-06-19 01:00 +08:00`: `oauth account upsert`, `apply_pending_billing_log`, and the
  downstream request-path billing failures that bubble up as `/api/tavily/search` or MCP proxy
  errors.
- `insert_token_log_pending_billing` now writes `auth_token_logs` + `billing_ledger` in one
  transaction and retries transient SQLite writer contention inside a `10s` application budget.
  The retry/exhaustion logs emit stable structured fields for `operation`, `request_path`,
  `request_kind`, `attempt|attempts`, `backoff_ms`, `elapsed_ms`, `retry_budget_ms`,
  `pending_batch_counts`, `oldest_pending_created_at`, `newest_pending_created_at`, and
  `billing_subject_kind`.
- `apply_pending_billing_log` now emits the same structured contention contract, keyed by the
  request path/kind already stored on the pending billing row, so “short contention recovered” and
  “budget exhausted, fail closed” are distinguishable in production logs without exposing the raw
  billing subject.
- Background scheduler/worker DB work now has unified phase logs around `scheduled job enqueue`
  and `request stats persist`, so `quota-sync-hot enqueue`, `scheduled job finish`, and request
  stats flush contention all have a stable DB operation prefix in addition to the existing
  owner-facing warning lines.
- Added a shared transient SQLite write retry helper for bounded backoff.
- `quota_subject_locks` acquire/refresh/release now retry transient SQLite busy/locked errors within
  the existing lock timeout or lease budget.
- Scheduled job start/finish writes now retry transient SQLite busy/locked errors before surfacing
  failure to background schedulers.
- OAuth account upsert/profile refresh wrapper calls now retry transient SQLite busy/locked errors
  before returning failures to LinuxDo login or daily sync flows.
- Forward-proxy startup now refreshes subscription-backed endpoints concurrently, syncs xray state
  from the restored snapshot, and retries runtime snapshot persistence when SQLite briefly denies
  the write slot.
- Forward-proxy startup now restores persisted subscription endpoints from `forward_proxy_runtime`
  before attempting remote subscription refresh when the current settings contain one unambiguous
  subscription source. If restored endpoints exist, startup skips the blocking remote refresh and
  proceeds to xray sync/runtime persistence; the existing maintenance scheduler performs
  subscription calibration after the service is running.
- Serving-role `/health` now calls a strict forward-proxy readiness check that ignores the internal
  startup grace window. `single`, `full_master`, and `provisional_master` stay red until the
  forward-proxy runtime and shared xray are actually ready, while the accepted
  `standby` / `recovery` HA carve-out remains unchanged.
- `rebuild_server_pressure_buckets()` no longer blocks proxy construction or first healthy. Serving
  roles trigger one background rebuild after the listener is already ready, invalidate the cached
  analysis-pressure snapshot on success, and isolate rebuild failure to logs instead of business
  readiness.
- `user_business_calls_1h` now rehydrates during proxy construction again so owner-facing dashboard
  summaries are populated before strict serving readiness can turn green. The rehydrate path keeps
  the cheap indexed startup snapshot, optional `request_log_id` dedupe, and upper-bound merge
  logic so later background refreshes can still run safely on HA promotion without double-counting.
- Request-log effect-bucket repair now short-circuits via a meta marker plus a cheap indexed
  precheck, and the rewrite plus marker commit now share one transaction so partial restarts cannot
  leave mixed migrated/unmarked state behind.
- The same post-ready rebuild hook now runs on later HA promotions that restore a
  `provisional_master` / `full_master` serving role, including the shared admin/internal finalize
  path that persists HA status snapshots.
- The post-ready hook is now gated per writable tenure. Startup or a later transition from
  non-writable to writable may start one `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild and one
  `user_business_calls_1h` backfill, but the repeating HA authority refresh while the node remains
  writable only emits one suppressed decision log instead of rerunning the derived work every
  refresh interval.
- HA demotion now cancels any in-flight `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild generation before the
  node finishes leaving business-serving mode, so standby/recovery do not keep detached rebuild
  writes alive.
- Each `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild now reads and replaces buckets from one transactional
  request-log snapshot and rolls back if cancellation lands before commit, avoiding mixed snapshots
  from concurrent request-log maintenance changes.
- Cold startup now fans subscription-URL fetches across the whole configured set in one wave, so a
  5-8 URL subscription config no longer stretches strict readiness across multiple 60-second
  timeout batches before xray/runtime can finish initializing.
- The container image `HEALTHCHECK` now polls the stricter `/health` contract with
  `start-period=20s`, `interval=5s`, `timeout=5s`, and `retries=18`, and the healthcheck command
  itself now probes only `/health`. Container healthy therefore flips on the first successful
  strict `/health` probe instead of waiting behind an extra fixed 20-second gate.
- Forward-proxy startup also stopped doing one redundant runtime-store write on the happy path:
  runtime/xray sync persists the snapshot once, and startup no longer immediately replays the same
  snapshot back into SQLite a second time before readiness.
- LinuxDo system tag binding backfill now uses a single indexed startup precheck and only repairs
  mismatched rows before readiness. A background scheduler periodically refreshes the bindings and
  quota snapshots after the service is already listening.
- Request-log retention GC now runs in bounded batches for both `request_logs` and
  `request_log_catalog_rollups`, yields briefly between batches, and reports whether more catch-up
  work remains.
- Request-log GC unlinks old child-table references before deleting old `request_logs`, ensures
  supporting reference indexes, uses a lightweight CLI open path that skips full startup
  migrations, and disables SQLite secure-delete for the delete connection so retention cleanup does
  not spend extra CPU overwriting expired payload pages.
- Request-log GC temporarily removes and restores the catalog-rollup delete trigger inside each
  batch transaction. The old rollup buckets are deleted separately in bounded batches, avoiding a
  per-row trigger update for expired request payloads while keeping normal request log writes and
  updates covered by the trigger set.
- The daily `request_logs_gc` scheduler now runs one bounded cleanup pass per
  `scheduled_jobs` row. If backlog remains, it persists an automatic continuation with a
  five-minute `available_at` delay instead of keeping one long-running `running` row open.
- Scheduled jobs now distinguish `trigger_source` from `job_type`, use an atomic claim path to avoid
  duplicate active work, and expose manual trigger entrypoints for maintenance/admin jobs.
- `quota_sync` now uses a hard `/usage` timeout, a bounded job runtime budget, and claim-time stale
  running row reclamation for `quota_sync` / `quota_sync/hot`, so hung syncs self-heal instead of
  blocking future runs until a restart.
- Request-log GC catch-up now uses smaller scheduler windows with a faster recheck cadence so a
  large body-cleanup backlog can make daily progress without one pass holding the SQLite writer
  slot for long.
- DB maintenance now records size/freelist telemetry and can compact the SQLite file through a
  dedicated job, with automatic threshold-based triggering and manual admin triggering.
- Added `db_compaction_once` as an offline operational binary. It reuses the same threshold gate as
  the scheduler, supports `--force`, and avoids depending on the in-process admin trigger when the
  DB execution gate is busy.
- DB-backed scheduled and manual jobs now pass through a process-wide execution gate before their
  SQLite write windows. The gate covers retention GC, compaction, quota sync, rollups, session GC,
  backoff GC, auth-token log GC, and LinuxDo sync/refresh jobs while preserving the existing
  scheduled-job claim/finish semantics.
- Request-log GC catch-up releases the DB job execution gate between cleanup windows so the
  scheduler delay does not block other DB-backed jobs.
- `scheduled_jobs` now persists queue admission explicitly: `queued_at` is stored for every
  maintenance row, `started_at` is nullable until the worker actually starts execution, and job list
  APIs order by `COALESCE(started_at, queued_at)` so queued work remains visible.
- Added queue-side primitives on top of `scheduled_jobs`: enqueue/coalesce, dequeue, mark-running,
  lookup-by-id, and abandon-all-active semantics.
- Scheduler loops now enqueue DB-backed maintenance work instead of trying to claim-and-run inline.
  One in-process maintenance worker consumes queued jobs, preserves manual-first priority, and
  reuses the existing per-job execution logic.
- Remote-I/O maintenance families (`quota_sync*`, LinuxDo user sync, GEO refresh, and
  reconciliation) share one instance-owned actual-request lease. The lease begins only at outbound
  HTTP and releases after response/error handling, while DB-only jobs can advance during local
  preparation or durable finalization.
- Coalesced active jobs now promote `trigger_source` even while the representative row is already
  `running`, so a later manual trigger is visible in both the returned trigger response and the
  persisted job row instead of being silently hidden behind the original scheduler source.
- Same-priority duplicate manual triggers now take a read-only coalesce fast path before attempting
  a write transaction. That keeps `POST /api/jobs/trigger` from returning transient SQLite
  `database is locked` errors when a bounded GC slice is already running and the request only needs
  to attach to the existing representative row.
- Request-log GC now requeues itself through the persisted queue when a bounded pass reports
  `completed=false`, so backlog catch-up no longer depends on one scheduler loop keeping a running
  row alive.
- `scheduled_jobs` now has an `available_at` eligibility timestamp and orders claims by effective
  priority, availability, admission time, and id. Non-manual jobs age one priority every five
  minutes down to effective priority `2`; manual jobs keep their original priority and can unlock a
  delayed representative row immediately.
- Body cleanup caches debug-share and heavy-usage retention context per user for the whole bounded
  pass. Its report includes candidate scan count, unique users, cache hits, query/decision/write
  timings, and a progress status. Online and CLI cleanup scan a fixed candidate window through the
  schema-validated `observability.idx_request_logs_time` cursor. They do not create or analyze a
  body partial index after readiness, so a large observability table cannot introduce an
  unbounded DDL writer hold on foreground traffic.
- Manual `POST /api/jobs/trigger` now accepts/coalesces queue work and returns the representative
  `job_id` instead of exposing `db_job_execution_busy`. The response also exposes representative
  queue hints (`status`, `coalesced`, `promoted`) so the admin UI can distinguish “newly queued”
  from “already running/queued”. Manual key quota sync still waits for a result, but it now does so
  by enqueueing `quota_sync` and polling the representative job row to a terminal state.
- `forward_proxy_geo_refresh` now follows the same split-phase model as quota sync and LinuxDo
  sync: remote trace/GEO discovery happens outside the DB execution gate, candidate persistence and
  `scheduled_jobs` completion happen inside a short DB window, and the worker may continue with
  other queued non-remote jobs while the single actual-request remote lease is in flight.
- Online billing-subject serialization no longer uses `quota_subject_locks` as the request-path
  mutex. The hot path now uses an in-process subject guard, keeping fail-closed billing semantics
  while removing acquire/refresh/release writes for every billable request.
- Added `billing_ledger` as the synchronous billing truth source. Pending/charged state,
  `billing_subject`, `business_credits`, request linkage, and settlement metadata are backfilled
  from `auth_token_logs` at startup and then maintained in `billing_ledger` on every new pending
  billing record and settlement.
- Billing-ledger startup repair is now no-op aware. Startup records a high-watermark metadata key,
  runs a cheap indexed precheck first, and only enters the historical full reconcile path when a
  gap or drift is detected. Steady-state restarts now log `billing ledger startup precheck skipped`
  instead of paying the full `billing_ledger` UPSERT cost every time.
- Pending-billing readers and rollups that previously scanned `auth_token_logs.billing_state` now
  read from `billing_ledger`, while `auth_token_logs.billing_state` is still mirrored for backward
  compatibility with existing admin/history surfaces.
- HA baseline capture now includes `billing_ledger`, so recovery/export paths preserve the new
  billing truth table.
- Added an in-process HA state coalescer. `persist_ha_node_state` and
  `persist_ha_sync_watermark` now merge writes inside a `1s / 100 keys` window, and owner-facing
  reads that require immediate consistency explicitly flush before returning.
- Added a request-stats coalescer for request-derived rollups. Hot-path `request_logs` inserts now
  synchronously write only the `request_logs` row itself, then enqueue:
  - dashboard request rollup deltas,
  - API-key usage bucket deltas,
  - request-log catalog rollup deltas,
  - auth-token `total_requests/last_used_at` deltas,
  - account request-rate (`account_usage_rollup_buckets` five-minute) deltas.
- Request-derived rollups flush in one background batcher (`1s / 100 pending keys`) instead of
  issuing synchronous rollup writes per request. Dashboard, summary, rankings, and hourly-window
  reads no longer flush that coalescer or acquire a dedicated write connection; they serve durable
  state while pending/flushing contributes only to freshness.
- `flush_request_stats_writes` now retries transient SQLite writer contention inside a bounded `10s`
  application budget before requeueing the drained batch. The retry/exhaustion logs include
  pending-batch counts plus the oldest/newest drained `created_at`, so operators can tell
  whether they are looking at recoverable flush pressure or final fail-closed exhaustion.
- The former dedicated `read_flush_pool` and synchronous read-side retry budget are removed.
  Background coalescer persistence retains its existing cadence and retry behavior.
- Public `/api/public/metrics` and the first `metrics` event on `/api/public/events` now reuse the
  same freshness-gated read path on top of `dashboard_request_rollup_buckets`. The read path checks
  the last flushed timestamp plus the oldest pending request-stat write and only triggers one
  synchronous flush when the requested window is actually stale.
- Public success breakdown month-tail fallback is now rollup-first and success-count-only. The
  live path no longer depends on `fetch_visible_request_log_window_metrics` /
  `WITH scoped_logs AS (...) FROM observability.request_logs`; it subtracts only the retained tail
  success count from the last daily bucket and keeps day/month public counters unchanged.
- Request observability tables now attach through a per-core sibling sidecar SQLite file
  (`<core-stem>-observability.db`) in the new layout. `request_logs`, `api_key_usage_buckets`,
  `dashboard_request_rollup_buckets`, and `request_log_catalog_rollups` are created in that
  sidecar for the steady-state layout. Smaller legacy single-DB SQLite files still migrate
  `request_logs` into the sidecar during startup, but large legacy DBs now stay on a temporary
  single-DB compatibility path when the inline copy would exceed the startup budget. In that mode,
  `observability` is attached back to the core file for startup and offline `request_logs_gc_once`
  until operators run the explicit offline sidecar cutover. That compatibility path must still keep
  the normal SQLite pool capacity; collapsing the pool to one connection makes `/api/summary`
  flushes and early scheduler enqueue paths fight for the same slot and can leave owner-facing
  reads returning transient 500s after `/health` is already green.
- Added `observability_sidecar_migrate` as an offline operator binary for that explicit cutover.
  The command:
  - always derives the sibling `*-observability.db` path from the core DB path,
  - probes whether normal startup would still be on the large-legacy compatibility path while
    preserving the normal attach decision for existing DBs,
  - supports `--dry-run` / `--json` reporting without mutating or creating the sidecar,
  - rejects missing or mistyped `--db-path` values before creating either the core DB file or the
    sibling sidecar file,
  - treats the write-probe result as best-effort metadata so read-only snapshots can still be
    inspected in dry-run mode,
  - requires the service to be stopped before a real migration by probing `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE`,
  - forces the sibling sidecar attach target instead of reusing the startup fallback,
  - copies only `main.request_logs` into `observability.request_logs` in `id` order with bounded
    batches and `NOT EXISTS` dedupe so reruns can resume partial copies safely,
  - rebuilds request-log soft-reference tables before removing `main.request_logs`,
  - validates preserved child references (`billing_ledger`, `api_key_maintenance_records`,
    `api_key_transient_backoffs`, and any existing `auth_token_logs.request_log_id`),
  - temporarily hides legacy `main` observability tables while reusing the existing sidecar layout
    rebuild routines, so unqualified rebuild SQL reads and writes the attached `observability`
    schema instead of the legacy `main` tables,
  - rebuilds sidecar `api_key_usage_buckets`, `dashboard_request_rollup_buckets`, and
    `request_log_catalog_rollups` before deleting any hidden legacy table,
  - drops the hidden legacy `main` observability tables before writing completion meta, so a
    crash cannot leave a false completed state with temporary legacy tables still present,
  - marks `api_key_usage_buckets_v1_done`,
    `api_key_usage_buckets_request_value_v2_done`,
    `dashboard_request_rollup_buckets_v1_done`,
    `request_log_catalog_rollup_v1_done`, and
    `request_log_catalog_rollup_v1_retention_days` complete, then writes
    `observability_sidecar_explicit_cutover_v1_done` before reporting success,
  - reports the derived rebuild booleans, completion-meta booleans,
    `startup_rebuild_required`, and `derived_rebuild_elapsed_ms` in JSON output.
- Startup now treats explicit large sidecar cutover as a completed offline operation. If
  `observability_sidecar_explicit_cutover_v1_done` is present, `main.request_logs` is gone, sidecar
  `request_logs` contains rows, and the derived rebuild meta is incomplete, startup fails fast with
  an instruction to rerun `observability_sidecar_migrate` instead of awaiting full derived-table
  rebuilds before the HTTP listener is ready. Legacy single-DB startup and small automatic sidecar
  migration remain allowed to use their bounded startup self-heal paths.
- Server/admin test helpers now mirror that sidecar layout instead of opening only the core DB
  file. SQLite schema assertions for `request_logs` and the other observability tables now probe
  the attached schema explicitly, which keeps migration and admin-route coverage aligned with the
  production attached-database layout even when both `main` and `observability` temporarily expose
  similarly named tables during legacy migration/repair paths.
- Auth-token list/admin-token/user-token reads and admin rate-5m usage series now also flush the
  request-stats coalescer before reading, so owner-facing token activity and request-rate charts
  stay current without putting those derived writes back on the request hot path.
- `request_log_catalog_rollups` no longer relies on per-request SQLite triggers for normal hot-path
  inserts. Owner-facing catalog reads keep a narrow rebuild-on-read fallback for legacy/manual SQL
  mutations so admin surfaces can self-heal if rollups were emptied or bypassed.
- `/api/logs` page reads now also ensure request-log catalog rollups are available before reading
  totals/facets, so an empty or bypassed rollup table does not make the admin logs surface show an
  empty total while visible `request_logs` rows still exist in the observability sidecar.
- The request-log GC path no longer drops/recreates the catalog delete trigger per batch, because
  the catalog rollup table is now maintained by the request-stats coalescer plus explicit rebuilds.
- SQLite attached-database trigger limits mean observability sidecar tables no longer participate
  in HA outbox trigger replication. Those tables are now treated as rebuildable/eventually
  consistent owner-facing views; the HA baseline remains focused on core truth tables such as
  `billing_ledger`, bindings, quota state, and control-plane facts.
- Auth-token log page/detail queries that join `billing_ledger` now qualify `auth_token_logs.*`
  columns explicitly and avoid unnecessary billing joins in count/facet queries. That removes the
  `ambiguous column name` regressions that appeared once synchronous billing truth moved out of
  `auth_token_logs` and the admin token-log surfaces began reading mixed ledger/history data.
- Alert events/groups/recent-summary/catalog reads now stop full-fetching alert events into Rust for
  in-memory paging/grouping. Those paths page and aggregate in SQL, canonicalize `request_kind`
  before filtering/grouping, and rely on dedicated `auth_token_logs` indexes for
  `failure_kind/result_status/token_id + created_at` windows.
- Service startup abandons leftover `queued` and `running` maintenance rows from the previous
  process lifetime before starting the new worker, except a delayed automatic `request_logs_gc`
  continuation. The exception preserves its durable `available_at` backoff across restart.
- Added `request_logs_gc_once` as a one-shot operational binary. It supports JSON output and
  `--run-until-complete` for deterministic low-resource validation against production-derived
  database samples.
- Added `request_logs_gc_stats` as a read-only operational binary for daily growth vs
  `cleaned_bodies` analysis directly from SQLite.
- Added local contention tests for quota subject lock acquisition and scheduled job start.
- Added queue lifecycle tests for coalesced enqueue promotion, delayed `started_at` materialization,
  and abandon-all-active restart cleanup semantics.
- Added coverage for manual trigger coalescing on an already running representative row, including
  the HTTP response hints returned by `/api/jobs/trigger`.
- Added regression coverage for duplicate manual trigger coalescing while another connection holds
  the SQLite writer slot, both at the store layer and through the owner-facing HTTP trigger route.
- Added request-rollup tests that prove public metrics skip synchronous flush when freshness is
  already current and perform one bounded flush when the live window is stale.
- Added `/mcp` end-to-end contention coverage:
  `cargo test mcp_tools_call_tavily_search_retries_pending_billing_when_sqlite_writer_lock_releases -- --nocapture`
  now holds `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` beyond SQLite's builtin `busy_timeout`, releases inside the
  application retry budget, and proves one billable `/mcp` request still returns `200` and charges
  quota after the writer lock clears.
- Extended alert endpoint coverage so request-kind filtered event/group reads continue returning the
  canonical keys exposed by the HTTP contract after the SQL-side pagination/aggregation rewrite.
- Added worker orchestration coverage that proves only one remote-I/O maintenance job enters
  `running` at a time and that `request_logs_gc` can still complete while a quota-sync remote phase
  is waiting on `/usage`.
- Added local contention coverage for forward-proxy startup subscription refresh and runtime
  snapshot persistence.
- Server-pressure startup rehydration now computes the 48-hour and 8-day source aggregates before
  acquiring `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; the write transaction contains only bucket replacement. A
  deterministic concurrency test pauses at that boundary and proves a foreground writer can still
  complete within 250ms. A read/write transition gate fences pre-snapshot direct writes; after the
  replacement, the tail buffer is detached and the rebuild atomically returns new events to direct
  persistence before replaying the finite tail in yielding batches.
- Added request-log GC coverage for old-row deletion, recent-row preservation, partial catch-up,
  catalog rollup cleanup, and transient SQLite write-lock retry.
- Added explicit sidecar-migration coverage for:
  - large legacy offline migration into the sibling sidecar,
  - dry-run reporting without sidecar creation,
  - idempotent reruns after a finished cutover,
  - resuming partial copies when the sidecar already contains a subset of `request_logs` ids,
  - rejecting startup when a cutover sidecar has historical rows but derived completion meta is
    missing,
  - preserving the large-legacy startup compatibility path and standalone `request_logs_gc_once`
    behavior until the explicit cutover is run.
- Explicit sidecar migration completion now requires a fresh normal startup reopen after the
  offline lock is released. The migration CLI/report surface gained
  `startup_reopen_verified`, and the final `completed=true` contract now means “offline rebuild
  succeeded and a normal startup reopen succeeded,” not just “the offline sidecar tables were
  rebuilt.”
- Added request-stats coverage proving summary/key-metric reads flush pending coalesced deltas on
  the healthy path.
- Added contention coverage proving `/api/summary`, rankings snapshot, and analysis-pressure
  snapshot return promptly under a held SQLite writer lock, including the case where a full-budget
  flush is already inflight, then expose the queued delta after the lock is released.

- One production sample showed `database is locked` `34` times and `slow statement` `296` times in
  the latest sampled hour while `/health` and `/api/version` stayed fast, confirming writer
  contention rather than process deadlock.
- The live hot-path evidence clustered around:
  `request stats persist`,
  `record_pending_billing_attempt failed for /mcp`,
  and retained-log month-tail scans shaped like
  `WITH scoped_logs AS (...) FROM observability.request_logs`.
- Host pressure (root volume near `99%`, swap heavily used) is now recorded as an amplifying
  factor, not the primary root cause.

## Rollout notes

- `project_doc_disposition=defer`: the deployment inventory/runbook remains a rollout-stage sync
  target because this round does not deploy from the repo.
- Post-deploy grep targets:
  `sqlite_transient_write_retry`,
  `sqlite_transient_write_exhausted`,
  `operation=request stats persist`,
  `operation=insert_token_log_pending_billing`,
  `operation=apply_pending_billing_log`.
- Add `component=admin_read` to the same grep set when owner-facing stats appear stalled. That
  separates “served durable fallback under contention” from “write-side retry budget exhausted”.
- Added request-stats coverage proving auth-token activity reads and admin rate-5m usage-series
  reads flush pending coalesced deltas before returning.
- Added request-log catalog coverage proving catalog reads still self-heal after direct SQL
  `request_logs` mutations and rollup rebuild scenarios.
- Added server-level regression coverage proving the admin logs page still returns rows/totals from
  the sidecar-backed `request_logs` layout and that token-log detail/page reads remain stable after
  the `billing_ledger` join split.
- Added process-level DB job execution gate coverage that proves overlapping jobs serialize before
  entering their write windows.
- Added startup-order coverage for restored subscription runtime with a slow subscription endpoint,
  plus the strict no-runtime fallback where startup still waits for subscription readiness.

## Operations Notes

- The `2026-06-19 01:00 +08:00` to `2026-06-19 10:18 +08:00` production sample that motivated
  this pass showed all three runtime responsibility surfaces at once:
  - startup: `forward-proxy startup: sqlite initialized in 38906ms`
  - background queueing/worker writes: `quota-sync-hot: enqueue job error`, `scheduled job finish`,
    `request stats persist warning`
  - request-path/user writes: `upsert linuxdo oauth account error`,
    `oauth account upsert: transient sqlite write error`, `apply_pending_billing_log`, and
    `/api/tavily/search` proxy failures bubbling a `database is locked`
- The new runtime DB logging contract is designed to map those same symptoms onto stable fields:
  - `component=db event=operation_slow operation="sqlite startup" ...`
  - `component=db event=operation_error operation="scheduled job enqueue" ...`
  - `component=db event=operation_error operation="request stats persist" ...`
  - `component=db event=operation_error|operation_slow operation="oauth account upsert" ...`
  - `component=db event=operation_error|operation_slow operation="apply_pending_billing_log" ...`
  - `sqlx::query` warn lines for statements slower than `250ms`
- Production baseline was read-only: container healthy, version `0.46.2`, database `8.3G`, WAL
  `235M`, and the most recent one-hour lock sample only showed LinuxDo OAuth upsert contention.
- Later production inspection found a `20G` database where startup spent roughly `78s` inside
  SQLite initialization; the repeated LinuxDo tag binding refresh over all OAuth accounts was a
  primary avoidable startup cost, so periodic refresh now runs outside the readiness path.
- A later request-log body-retention backlog produced a much larger main DB file even after row
  retention was no longer the primary issue. Deleting or nulling payloads alone leaves free pages in
  SQLite, so file-size convergence is handled as a separate compaction job after retention work.
- If production inspection shows long-lived `scheduled_jobs.running` rows from an older process,
  restart the service under the current stale-job cleanup path before relying on manual retriggers.
  The in-process execution gate prevents new same-process overlap; it does not rewrite stale rows
  while the old process is still considered active.
- The SQLite pool now defaults to `max_connections=3` instead of `5`, preserving WAL mode while
  reducing writer contention on the single-file production database.
- The recommended release path for this class of issue is: deploy code, perform one controlled
  restart, verify `/health`, inspect `scheduled_jobs` / `database is locked` logs, continue
  `request_logs_gc_once` if backlog remains, and only invoke `db_compaction_once` when reclaimable
  space crosses the threshold or operators explicitly force a maintenance window.
- The large-legacy sidecar cutover is now a separate operator runbook instead of an automatic
  startup side effect. The validated flow is:
  - on a shared testbox, seed a production-shaped legacy core DB snapshot, run the migration
    container first, then start the current-branch service image against the migrated files and
    verify `/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/tavily/search`, `/mcp`, and request-log reads;
  - on the production host, stop the service, export the pre-cutover core DB as the rollback
    anchor to the shared testbox, run `observability_sidecar_migrate` locally against the
    configured DB
    path, restart, and validate the same request-log and MCP surfaces;
  - if validation fails, stop the service, restore the pre-cutover core DB, delete the sibling
    `tavily_proxy-observability.db`, and then restart.
- The deployment-specific hostnames, paths, and cutover commands are intentionally omitted here.
  Keep those details in the private deployment inventory/runbook rather than the repository spec.
- The stop-service proof for this runbook is the sibling `tavily_proxy-observability-migrate.lock`:
  live server and GC paths hold it shared, while the explicit migration command must acquire it
  exclusively before mutating the legacy core DB. The remaining SQLite write probe stays in the
  JSON/plain report as a diagnostic signal, not as the primary proof that the live service exited.
- The explicit migration entrypoint rejects a missing or mistyped `--db-path` before it probes
  disk space, opens SQLite, or creates the sibling `observability-migrate.lock`, so typoed paths
  do not leave behind empty core, sidecar, or lock files.
- HA outbox GC now has a separate online budget (`250 x 4`, one second, 100ms yield) and uses the
  application's existing SQLite pool. The scheduler probes the maintenance write lease with
  `try_write`; writer contention becomes a durable 30-second continuation rather than a 10-second
  lock retry. Productive retention slices whose slowest active SQL micro-batch stays under 50ms continue in five seconds,
  while valid-only legacy scans stay at five minutes to avoid a permanent compatibility scan loop.
  The offline HA cleanup command keeps its larger CLI defaults. Online and offline active and
  maximum-batch timing fields accumulate only cleanup batches; command wall-clock remains separate
  so inter-batch yields and post-slice state probes do not masquerade as slow SQLite writes.

## Online HA cleanup isolation

- Online HA outbox cleanup no longer contends on the global HTTP maintenance write gate. A dedicated
  non-blocking GC lease serializes only GC slices, while scheduler diagnostics distinguish queue age,
  scheduled delay, and eligible wait. A scheduled continuation therefore does not produce a false
  queue-wait alert before its `available_at` time.
- HA cleanup keeps an hourly baseline sweep for newly expired rows. Its five-minute watchdog reads
  the durable pending-channel mask and only coalesces a representative job when unfinished channel
  debt remains, avoiding repeated clean-state GC writes. A deferred-continuation fallback writes
  its selected channel bit and per-channel defer state in the same short transaction, so a cleared
  mask cannot hide a lost continuation from the watchdog.

## Transaction and claim lifecycle

## 2026-08-02 self-healing and bounded-memory implementation

- Online HA GC uses a process-local lease and the application SQLite pool, records foreground
  activity in a lock-free one-second meter, and never waits for the HTTP maintenance read gate.
  Retention work is one-channel round-robin with adaptive `25..250` batches, a one-second slice, and
  one-second recovery continuations only after the persisted low-pressure window is satisfied.
- The durable per-channel state is controller-owned: it records eligibility, claim generation,
  batch adaptation, legacy cursor, progress and defer state together. Controller completion chooses
  the earliest eligible wake, so a five-minute legacy scan or a 30-second busy defer cannot freeze
  the other two channels.
- `scheduled_jobs.claim_generation` fences stale finish/error/continuation writes. HA continuation
  enqueue is atomic with finish; failed persistence is left for stale reaper recovery instead of an
  unbounded retry task.
- Reconciliation candidate selection is an indexed bounded page. Local pressure has its own short
  backoff; an observed upstream 429 applies the `5/10/20/30` minute cooldown only to the triggering
  `period_reconciliation` key and honors the maximum `Retry-After`. Legacy global-backoff metadata
  remains diagnostic-only and never gates reconciliation.
- Business-call usage keeps only the last hour as events, stores older history in five-minute buckets,
  and backfills in 500-row pages while preserving a request-log tail captured at the start.
- Normal GC/reconciliation phases and per-key 429 diagnostics are DEBUG. INFO is aggregated at a
  one-minute window, while state transitions, stale recovery, budget exhaustion, and SLO breaches
  remain immediately visible.

- Raw immediate transactions use an owning guard that commits or rolls back explicitly and detaches
  the physical connection if cancellation drops an open transaction.
- The first `SqliteRuntime` containment slice owns HA baseline/events read snapshots, generic billing
  audit snapshots, and Dashboard integrity immediate writes. A source gate prevents those production
  paths from adding manual transaction SQL outside the allowlisted runtime/migration/CLI boundary.
- The online dual-database snapshot helper now uses private permissions, collision-free owned paths,
  capacity checks, per-database timeouts, a read-only network-disabled helper, transfer hashes and
  integrity checks, plus exact failure cleanup before production-shaped shared-testbox validation.
- Scheduled jobs increment `claim_generation` when claimed. All scheduler completion paths and
  atomic continuations match the generation, while the periodic stale reaper safely requeues only
  the currently running generation.

- Reconciliation now separates main settlement from a unique Research drain. The drain batches the
  candidate key/cooldown hydration. Local budget pressure is persisted separately from remote 429
  pressure, while HA GC normal progress is emitted through the existing per-channel 60-second
  sampling window.
- Reconciliation terminal completion is typed. `no_adjustment` completes the exact usage generation
  after a valid zero-delta observation, while transport, semantic, local-pressure and upstream-429
  outcomes retain independent retry state instead of being collapsed into a generic retry.
- The final reconciliation path separates request-start, remote-observation, settlement-finalization,
  and durable-postprocessing deadlines. Research outcome, Key cooldown, exact cursor, and claim
  fence share one bounded transaction, and
  local pressure metadata is included in the HA meta baseline so takeover preserves its backoff state.
