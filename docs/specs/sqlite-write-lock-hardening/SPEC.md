# SQLite write-lock hardening（#2wdrp）

## Background

Production `tavily-hikari` `0.46.2` showed transient SQLite `database is locked` errors after API
rebalance was enabled. The service remained healthy, but logs included request-path failures such as
`token billing lock failed` for `/api/tavily/search` and `/api/tavily/extract`, plus MCP session
lock failures and background job start failures.

The observed behavior points to SQLite writer contention rather than API rebalance selector
misrouting. Billing, MCP session serialization, quota sync, scheduled job logging, LinuxDo OAuth
upserts, and rollups all share the same SQLite database and can briefly compete for the single
writer slot.

After the first maintenance-queue hardening, the remaining production noise shifted toward request
hot-path writes: billing-subject lock rows, request-log derived rollups, and HA runtime snapshots.
The topic now also covers shrinking those synchronous hot-path write windows without weakening
billing correctness.

Forward-proxy startup also participates in this same lock budget: it refreshes subscription-backed
endpoints, syncs xray state, and persists runtime snapshots before the HTTP server reports itself
ready. That startup path can amplify a short writer collision into a slow first healthy when the
runtime snapshot write collides with other writers.

Dockrev `job_01KSEPDVXF8NAQCEQGJKV33T4F` showed a related startup-order failure after the previous
hardening: the service was healthy before restart, but startup still waited on remote subscription
refresh before restoring the locally persisted subscription runtime. A restart should recover known
proxy nodes from `forward_proxy_runtime` first; remote subscription refresh is only the calibration
source when a usable persisted runtime already exists.

## Goals

- Keep request-path billing and MCP session locks from failing on transient SQLite busy/locked
  errors when the existing bounded wait budget can absorb the contention.
- Keep billable `/mcp` request completion and pending-billing settlement on the same bounded
  transient-write retry contract, so a short production writer lock no longer produces
  `record_pending_billing_attempt failed for /mcp: database is locked` while the upstream response
  itself was otherwise successful.
- Preserve quota ledger correctness, pending billing replay, session affinity, research key pinning,
  and API rebalance behavior.
- Remove avoidable request hot-path SQLite writes that do not need to be synchronous truth, while
  preserving fail-closed billing semantics and owner-facing observability.
- Keep public success metrics on rollup-first bounded reads so month-tail fallback no longer depends
  on a retained-log wide scan against `observability.request_logs`.
- Make background job bookkeeping tolerate transient lock pressure without amplifying request-path
  failures.
- Keep forward-proxy startup from turning short SQLite writer contention into a long readiness
  delay.
- Keep serving-role `/health` from reporting green before the forward-proxy runtime and shared xray
  are actually ready for core business traffic.
- Keep non-core derived observability rebuild work such as `server_pressure_buckets` out of the
  listener-before-ready critical path.
- Cover the lock-contention behavior with local tests that use only local/mock state.

## Non-goals

- No production data repair, destructive maintenance, or hand-written production ledger SQL.
- No increase to the SQLite connection pool as the primary fix.
- No billing reservation redesign unless this hardening proves insufficient.
- No change to public HTTP, MCP, DB schema, or frontend contracts.

## Requirements

- `quota_subject_locks` acquire/refresh/release writes must retry transient SQLite write errors with
  bounded backoff and must remain inside the existing lock timeout/lease budget.
- Token billing and MCP session lock callers must retain the current fail-closed semantics if the
  bounded retry window is exhausted.
- `record_pending_billing_attempt*`, `insert_token_log_pending_billing`, and
  `apply_pending_billing_log` must share one bounded transient SQLite write retry contract.
  Successful recovery within budget must keep the request/settlement green; budget exhaustion must
  still fail closed.
- `scheduled_jobs` must remain the persisted fact source for maintenance work, but it now needs a
  first-class queued lifecycle: `queued` rows persist before execution, `queued_at` records queue
  admission time, and `started_at` only records the actual execution start time.
- `scheduled_jobs` enqueue/start/finish writes must retry transient SQLite write errors before
  surfacing a background job logging failure.
- LinuxDo OAuth account upsert/refresh calls must retry transient SQLite write errors at the proxy
  boundary so a short writer collision does not immediately fail user login/profile sync.
- `forward_proxy` startup runtime snapshot persistence must retry transient SQLite write errors with
  bounded backoff so a short writer collision does not delay readiness longer than necessary.
- Startup subscription refresh may fetch multiple subscription URLs concurrently, as long as the
  refresh still fails closed when every subscription fetch fails.
- When startup has no safely restorable subscription runtime, the configured subscription URL set
  must still complete in one startup wave instead of fixed 4-URL timeout batches, so strict cold
  startup wall time stays bounded by a single subscription-fetch timeout.
- Startup must restore persisted subscription endpoints before remote subscription refresh when
  their configured subscription ownership is unambiguous. When at least one restored subscription
  endpoint exists, startup must not block on remote refresh before xray sync/runtime persistence;
  without safely restorable endpoints, startup continues to wait for subscription readiness.
- Serving-role `GET /health` must ignore the forward-proxy startup grace window. If the current
  business-serving role still depends on local relay and shared xray/runtime is not actually ready,
  `/health` must return non-`200` immediately instead of reporting a grace-period green state.
- `active_standby` `standby` / `recovery` keep the accepted HA minimal-health carve-out: their
  `/health` contract remains `200 ok` even when xray/runtime is intentionally not prewarmed.
- `rebuild_server_pressure_buckets()` must not block listener bind, first strict `/health`, or
  first healthy image status. Once the process is already serving business traffic, it may run once
  as a best-effort background rebuild whose failure is isolated to logs/observability and does not
  turn serving `/health` red.
- Request-path pressure observations and rebalance audits must not synchronously wait for SQLite's
  writer. They enter instance-owned bounded deferred queues; pressure deltas are replayable from
  request logs, while a rejected rebalance audit records explicit stale coverage without changing
  MCP success or billing truth. Every deferred flush uses `SqliteRuntime` operation budgets.
- Administrator API-key creation and undelete are foreground durable commands. Their SQLite
  acquire, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, and connection-local busy wait use the `AdminMutation` runtime
  operation and one bounded retry window. Exhausted transient contention returns a retryable
  typed defer; the single-key endpoint maps it to `503 Retry-After: 1`, while batch callers retain
  their existing explicit per-item failure result. Neither path waits for SQLite's default busy
  timeout or reports a false successful mutation.
- Administrator privacy-status reads use one AppState-owned last-good controller. HTTP handlers
  only copy its immutable value: an expired cached value must return additive stale coverage while
  one low-priority refresh runs or is deferred, and a true cold miss must return
  `503 Retry-After: 1`. A deferred startup prewarm retries in the background without consuming
  foreground capacity. A refresh must explicitly close its `AdminPrivacyRead` snapshot at a
  cooperative completion boundary. Its two-second SQLite run budget combines a progress handler for
  the active statement with an explicit check before every next SQLite phase, so a series of short
  statements cannot extend the snapshot past the budget. Both boundaries are cleared before
  rollback and report the failed operation; an HTTP deadline or graceful shutdown must never cancel
  an open SQLite transaction.
- The pressure-bucket rebuild must compute its bounded source aggregates without an immediate write
  transaction. It may acquire SQLite's writer only for the final small bucket replacement; the
  upper-bound request-log id and buffered live-event replay preserve the handoff across those two
  phases. Entering rebuild mode must use a shared/exclusive transition gate with incremental
  writers so direct writes that began earlier finish before the source fence. Completion must take
  one buffer snapshot and atomically return new events to direct persistence before replaying that
  finite tail in yielding batches.
- Non-core startup repairs must stay partitioned by contract. `user_business_calls_1h` history
  backfill is an owner-facing readiness view and must be cheaply rehydrated before serving starts
  reporting ready, while one-time request-log effect-bucket repair remains a startup maintenance
  step that must stay cheap/no-op aware on steady-state restarts and must not decide serving
  `/health`.
- If a later HA transition promotes the process back into a business-serving role, the same
  best-effort `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild must be scheduled for that serving tenure too.
- Post-ready derived work must be scheduled on writable-tenure edges, not on every persisted HA
  authority refresh. Initial startup or the first observed transition into `provisional_master` /
  `full_master` may run one `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild and one `user_business_calls_1h`
  backfill; repeated writable observations in the same tenure must suppress new task launches, and
  any observed non-writable role must re-arm the gate for a later writable promotion.
- If HA demotes the process out of a business-serving role while that rebuild is still pending, the
  rebuild must cancel or roll back instead of committing new pressure buckets from a standby or
  recovery process.
- The default image `HEALTHCHECK` must align with the stricter serving contract by using
  `start-period=20s`, `interval=5s`, `timeout=5s`, and `retries=18`, while the healthcheck command
  itself probes only the strict `/health` contract. The first healthy transition must happen on the
  first successful strict `/health` probe instead of waiting for an extra fixed startup hold window.
- Scheduled job records must preserve the logical job type and record the trigger source separately
  as `scheduler`, `manual`, or `auto`. Manual runs must not be encoded by appending suffixes to
  `job_type`.
- Manual scheduled-job triggers must use the same execution path as scheduler runs, coalesce onto an
  existing `queued`/`running` representative row of the same logical job, and return that
  representative `job_id` instead of rejecting on a shared execution gate timeout. If foreground
  SQLite admission cannot persist an `ha_outbox_gc` representative, the endpoint returns `503`; it
  must not claim `202` acceptance with a synthetic job id. The controller/watchdog owns automatic
  recovery without a background retry loop.
- Manual trigger responses may add queue-state hints such as representative `status`,
  `coalesced=true`, and `promoted=true` as long as the existing `jobId` / `jobType` /
  `triggerSource` contract remains backward compatible.
- `request_logs_gc` must not hold the SQLite write slot for an unbounded full-retention cleanup
  pass. It must delete old `request_logs` and `request_log_catalog_rollups` in bounded batches,
  yield between batches, report partial progress, and continue catch-up after a throttled delay when
  more rows remain.
- `quota_sync` and `quota_sync/hot` must run under a bounded runtime budget. Upstream `/usage`
  fetches must use a hard timeout, timeout/error paths must finish the `scheduled_jobs` row as
  `error`, and failed runs must not write quota snapshot/sample data.
- Claiming `quota_sync` / `quota_sync/hot` must abandon stale `running` rows older than the
  configured timeout window inside the same claim transaction, so a stuck job does not block future
  sync attempts forever.
- DB-backed scheduled and manual maintenance jobs that can write SQLite must flow through one
  persisted maintenance queue and one single-process worker. The worker may orchestrate remote I/O
  phases outside the DB execution window, but only one maintenance job may hold the SQLite-writing
  execution gate at a time, and the worker must not fan out multiple remote-I/O maintenance jobs at
  once just because those phases are outside SQLite.
- Request-log GC catch-up must finish one bounded slice, persist its progress message, and requeue a
  fresh `queued` row when more backlog remains instead of keeping one long-lived `running` row while
  waiting for the next catch-up opportunity.
- Persisted maintenance queue ordering must use an `available_at` eligibility timestamp and a
  five-minute age adjustment for non-manual jobs. The adjustment may raise an older job only to
  effective priority `2`; manual priority remains unchanged. This prevents fresh GC continuation
  rows from indefinitely starving HA cleanup or other aged maintenance work.
- Incomplete automatic request-log GC must requeue with a persisted five-minute delay. A manual
  trigger may reuse and immediately unlock its queued representative row. Body cleanup must cache
  retention context per unique user for a bounded pass, and its `(created_at, id)` partial body
  cursor index must be built by a low-priority post-ready maintenance task rather than schema
  bootstrap. The online scheduler obtains `maintenance_bulk` admission before acquiring a
  connection; when a required local-day seal is absent it records one typed incomplete result and
  defers instead of repeating raw-row, reference-unlink, or rollup work in that slice.
- The request-log GC completion and its incomplete five-minute continuation must be one fenced
  queue transaction. If the short control transaction cannot commit, the current claim remains
  running for the request-log stale reaper; it must not finish first and then silently lose a
  separate continuation enqueue. A permanent GC error must retain `error` status on the completed
  claim while still recording its delayed continuation.
- Service startup must abandon leftover `queued` or `running` maintenance rows from the previous
  process lifetime rather than implicitly resuming them after restart, except an automatic
  `request_logs_gc` continuation that remains queued so its persisted `available_at` delay survives.
- SQLite file size must converge after retention cleanup. The service must expose DB size/freelist
  telemetry, automatically trigger compaction when reclaimable space crosses the configured
  threshold, and provide a manual compaction trigger. Health checks must remain available while DB
  maintenance is active.
- A one-shot request-log GC CLI must reuse the same bounded cleanup path so production database
  samples can be validated deterministically without waiting for the daily scheduler.
- A one-shot DB compaction CLI must reuse the same threshold logic, support forced execution for a
  maintenance window, and remain available even when the in-process admin trigger is blocked by the
  DB execution gate.
- Request-log GC must avoid high-resource catch-up strategies such as rebuilding the whole
  `request_logs` table or generating a large WAL. Large backlogs are expected to catch up over
  repeated bounded windows.
- Retry logs may include operation, attempt, backoff, and final error context.
- Retry/exhaustion logs for this topic must expose a stable structured contract with
  `operation`, `request_path`, `request_kind`, `attempt|attempts`, `backoff_ms`, `elapsed_ms`,
  `retry_budget_ms`, `pending_batch_counts`, `oldest_pending_created_at`,
  `newest_pending_created_at`, and `billing_subject_kind`. The subject kind must remain one of
  `token|account|unknown`; raw billing subjects, request bodies, and token secrets must not appear.
- Request-path billing-subject serialization may rely on an in-process guard for the current
  single-process active node, instead of persisting a SQLite lock row for every request.
- Pending/charged billing truth may move to a dedicated `billing_ledger` table as long as pending
  replay, settlement idempotency, and admin/history compatibility remain intact.
- Request-derived dashboard/API-key/catalog rollups may be buffered in-memory and flushed in bounded
  background windows. Dashboard, summary, hourly-window, and rankings reads must serve durable data
  without acquiring a write connection or synchronously flushing; pending/flushing state may affect
  internal freshness while the existing HTTP response shape remains unchanged.
- A request-stats flush may use its 50ms retry budget to reject pool acquisition, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`,
  or a later chunk. Once a transaction has started, its runtime-owned finish must commit or roll
  back before the coalescer requeues anything; elapsed wall-clock budget alone must not requeue a
  batch whose commit is still in flight.
- The three-connection application pool reserves two actual or immediately allocatable slots for
  foreground work. Bulk maintenance takes one instance-local permit only when foreground arrival
  rate is at most `5 rps` and the preceding five seconds contain no pool-timeout or SQLite busy
  outcome. Admission rejection occurs before pool acquisition and records a typed deferred reason.
- Scheduled-job metadata writes are `maintenance_control`: they use a `100ms` connection/writer
  budget, do not wait for the bulk permit, and never start an unbounded retry task. A durable
  representative row or claim-fenced stale recovery owns later retry.
- Scheduler dequeue and next-wake reads are also `maintenance_control`: they acquire through the
  same bounded operation path. If an actual remote-attempt lease makes the first candidate page
  ineligible, the scheduler must perform one bounded local-only fallback lookup before yielding.
- The same bounded in-memory buffering model may also cover other request-derived observability
  counters such as auth-token activity and account request-rate buckets, provided billing truth
  stays synchronous and owner-facing reads use durable fallback instead of inheriting any write-side
  retry budget.
- Observability-heavy tables may live in a separate attached SQLite file when they are not required
  for synchronous billing truth. In that layout, `request_logs`, request-derived rollups, and other
  rebuildable observability tables are allowed to be eventually consistent and are not required to
  participate in HA outbox trigger replication; rebuild/export paths remain the recovery mechanism
  for those derived views.
- Startup must not force a large legacy single-DB `request_logs` table through an inline sidecar
  migration when that copy would exceed the startup budget. In that case, observability must remain
  attached to the core DB for startup and offline `request_logs_gc_once`, while smaller legacy DBs
  still migrate into the sibling sidecar automatically.
- Large legacy single-DB samples must now support an explicit offline cutover command:
  `observability_sidecar_migrate --db-path <path> [--batch-size 5000] [--dry-run] [--json]`.
  The command must require operators to stop the service first, must force the sibling sidecar
  attach path instead of reusing the large-legacy startup fallback, and must copy only
  `request_logs` into the sidecar while rebuilding or self-healing the derived observability tables
  in the new layout.
- The explicit sidecar migration contract must be resumable and idempotent. Re-running the command
  after a partial copy must preserve existing `observability.request_logs` rows by `id`, continue
  copying any missing `main.request_logs` rows in bounded batches, keep soft `request_log_id`
  references valid, rebuild all derived observability tables in the sibling sidecar layout, delete
  the legacy `main.request_logs` and legacy `main` rollup/bucket tables, then mark the corresponding
  meta keys complete and write the explicit cutover marker
  `observability_sidecar_explicit_cutover_v1_done`. The command must not report completion until a
  normal restart can attach the sibling sidecar without running a full derived-table rebuild, and
  the reopened startup path has been verified after the offline lock is released.
  A DB where the legacy tables are already gone but this explicit marker or the derived completion
  meta is missing is an interrupted cutover, not an `already_migrated` success; rerunning the tool
  must rebuild and mark the sidecar offline.
  Completion meta must be interpreted as complete only when the value is exactly `1`; present
  `0` values mean rebuild-needed and must not satisfy either the offline `already_migrated` check
  or the startup guard.
  Offline rebuild SQL for `api_key_usage_buckets` must preserve the `valuable_failure_429_count`
  metric, not just the aggregate success/error buckets.
- Startup must not run large sidecar derived-table rebuilds after an explicit cutover. If a cutover
  DB has the explicit cutover marker, `main.request_logs` removed, and sidecar `request_logs`
  present but the derived rebuild meta is incomplete, startup must fail fast with an
  operator-facing instruction to rerun `observability_sidecar_migrate`. Startup self-heal for
  legacy single-DB and small automatic sidecar migration remains outside this explicit-cutover
  fail-fast guard.
- Sidecar-aware schema self-heal paths must probe the attached `observability` schema explicitly.
  When both `main.request_logs` and `observability.request_logs` exist during migration or repair,
  column-existence checks must not accidentally read the wrong schema and issue duplicate `ALTER TABLE` statements.
- Shared-testbox validation for this path must remain isolated under `/srv/codex/**`, use a unique
  Compose project and run directory, avoid global Docker cleanup, and only remove this owner’s
  inactive workspaces or runs after confirming they are not referenced by any live
  `com.docker.compose.project`.
- The production cutover procedure is a short maintenance-window, local-host migration. Operators
  must stop the service, export a pre-cutover cold backup of the core DB to a rollback anchor, run
  the offline migration on the target host itself, restart and validate, and if anything fails
  restore the pre-cutover core DB and delete the sibling sidecar before bringing the service back.

## Acceptance

### Cancellation-safe maintenance transactions

- Production code that uses raw `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` must own the pooled physical connection through a
  runtime guard. Successful work commits explicitly; handled failures roll back explicitly; caller
  cancellation transfers an already-started transaction to the runtime owner, which resolves it
  before returning the connection. Detach is reserved for panic, shutdown, or an unverifiable state.
- HA baseline/events read sessions and generic audit snapshots must use the same cancellation-safe
  ownership rule. Dashboard integrity's temporary busy timeout is restored only after commit; any
  cancellation, rollback failure, or unfinished transaction closes the physical connection.
- A source dependency gate must reject new production manual transaction statements outside the
  runtime module, startup migrations, offline CLIs, and tests.
- Scheduled-job claims carry a monotonically increasing `claim_generation`. Completion, failure,
  and atomic continuation persistence must match both job id and generation.
- The stale-job reaper may recover an HA GC claim after 120 seconds or an upstream reconciliation
  claim after 60 seconds. Recovery increments the generation and applies the existing 30-second
  delay, making repeated reaper passes idempotent.

- Online HA cleanup enters recovery mode only after a persisted five-minute window at or below `5`
  foreground requests per second. Recovery uses a one-second continuation while the current slice
  remains within its one-second wall-clock and 50ms active-SQL targets; foreground pressure, busy
  writers, or slow work returns the affected channel to a 30-second continuation. Every slice
  processes one channel and persists the round-robin cursor, channel eligibility, oldest deletable
  age, deletion rate, debt mode, recovery deadline, and SLO state. The scheduler wakes at the
  earliest eligible channel and must not turn one channel's delay into a global freeze.
- An expired scheduled-job claim returns an internal stale-claim result. It cannot finish, enqueue a
  continuation, or mutate a newer claim with the same job id. HA continuation persistence is part of
  the finish transaction; a transient conflict may use a fixed, bounded same-generation retry, or
  leave the running claim for stale reaper recovery. It must never create an unbounded background
  retry loop.
- Reconciliation candidate selection and key/cooldown hydration are bounded local bulk work before
  any remote request; they must acquire admission and release it before remote I/O. Three consecutive
  rounds with eligible candidates but no remote attempt and exhausted local budget enter a persisted
  short local backoff with one delayed representative job. Only actual upstream 429 attempts enter
  the persisted `5/10/20/30` minute cooldown for the affected `period_reconciliation` key and honor
  `Retry-After`; a cooldown never gates healthy keys.
- Reconciliation main settlement and Research polling have separate durable jobs. The drain owns
  Research selection and performs one request at a time no earlier than five seconds apart; both
  jobs share only the request-scoped single remote lease, not one run deadline or local transaction.
  Aged main and aged Research representatives compete for the next automatic request after 120
  eligible seconds; a Research aged turn bypasses only the foreground-rate heuristic and still uses
  the bounded read, request lease, and claim-fenced control transaction. An accepted Research
  lease-contention defer retains its turn until the resumed request actually begins. Ordinary
  automatic remote jobs may prepare locally but wait at the request lease.
- A completed upstream observation with zero signed delta is a `no_adjustment` terminal outcome for
  the matching usage generation. It must not recreate the representative job until a later usage
  write projects new work.
- Settlement finalization has a reserved tail budget for a bounded current-ledger read, adjustment
  writes, and pressure-state markers; its billed-credit source-read gate runs before any remote
  request. An observation that completes before that tail is not discarded merely because no new
  remote request may start.
- The business-call cache keeps raw events for one hour and five-minute aggregates for the remaining
  1–25 hour window. Startup backfill reads 500-row pages and merges a captured request-log tail, so
  it never materializes the complete history or copies live events while holding the cache lock.

- Under a competing SQLite writer, acquiring a quota subject lock eventually succeeds after the
  writer releases within the existing wait budget.
- Under a competing SQLite writer that outlives SQLite's builtin busy timeout but releases before
  the bounded application retry budget, one billable `/mcp` tools/call request still returns `200`,
  records the billing row, and charges quota after the writer lock clears.
- Under a competing SQLite writer, scheduled job start retries rather than immediately returning
  `database is locked`.
- Under a competing SQLite writer, forward-proxy startup runtime snapshot persistence retries
  transient lock errors rather than failing the startup path immediately.
- With safely restorable persisted subscription runtime and a slow subscription endpoint, restart
  restores the local runtime and completes without waiting for the slow remote refresh.
- Without persisted subscription runtime, startup remains strict and waits for subscription
  readiness instead of reporting healthy from an empty proxy graph.
- Without persisted subscription runtime and with a small multi-URL subscription set, startup still
  waits for subscription readiness but does not spill into multiple 60-second timeout waves before
  strict health can turn green.
- When a serving role needs shared xray relay, `/health` returns non-`200` immediately until the
  runtime is actually ready even if the internal startup grace timer has not expired yet.
- In `active_standby`, `standby` / `recovery` still return `200 ok` on `/health` while runtime/xray
  prewarm is intentionally skipped.
- `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild no longer appears on the listener-before-ready critical path.
  After the process is already serving, one background rebuild repopulates historical buckets
  without making owner-facing pressure analysis return `500`.
- Manual or internal HA promotions that return the node to `provisional_master` / `full_master`
  still trigger the same post-ready `server_pressure_buckets` rebuild path as initial serving
  startup.
- Repeated HA authority refreshes for the same writable tenure do not repeatedly run post-ready
  `server_pressure_buckets` rebuilds or `user_business_calls_1h` backfills; after observing
  `standby` / `recovery`, the next writable promotion is allowed to run them once again.
- If the node is demoted to `standby` / `recovery` before that rebuild finishes, the detached task
  exits without committing new `server_pressure_buckets` rows from the non-serving role.
- Under mock/local upstream startup, the image `HEALTHCHECK` becomes healthy on the first
  successful probe after the stricter serving `/health` is truly green, with no extra fixed
  20-second minimum gate layered on top of
  `start-period=20s/interval=5s/timeout=5s/retries=18`.
- With a large backlog of old request logs, one scheduler pass records bounded progress instead of
  running indefinitely; later catch-up passes eventually remove all rows older than the retention
  threshold.
- Public success metrics continue to wait for inflight request-stat flushes, but the month-tail
  fallback no longer emits the retained-log wide scan shape
  `WITH scoped_logs AS (...) FROM observability.request_logs` on the public metrics path.
- When a competing SQLite writer outlives the short admin-read flush budget but clears before the
  full write-side retry budget, `/api/summary`, `GET /api/users/rankings`, and
  analysis-pressure/user-activity reads still return durable data promptly instead of timing out
  behind the full `10s` request-stats flush retry window. Once the lock clears, a later read must
  expose the queued delta.
- Overlapping DB-backed maintenance jobs in one process run through one persisted queue and one
  maintenance worker, so a second job is accepted/coalesced as `queued` instead of competing for the
  SQLite writer slot.
- With two queued remote-I/O maintenance jobs such as `quota_sync`, only one actual outbound request
  runs at a time. Local preparation and durable finalization do not hold the request lease, while
  non-remote maintenance work may still advance.
- Manual trigger API calls return a representative job id, job rows expose `trigger_source` plus
  `queued_at`, and duplicate active manual triggers coalesce onto the existing queued/running row
  instead of returning `db_job_execution_busy` or duplicate-running conflicts.
- After restart, leftover `queued` or `running` maintenance rows are marked `abandoned` with a
  completion timestamp before new queue work is accepted, except the delayed automatic
  `request_logs_gc` continuation. That continuation remains queued and becomes eligible only at its
  persisted `available_at`.
- A continuously incomplete request-log GC cannot prevent an aged `ha_outbox_gc` row from being
  claimed after the five-minute age window. Delayed automatic continuations remain ineligible after
  process recreation, while a manual trigger reuses and immediately unlocks the representative row.
- Body-GC cursor queries use the schema-validated `observability.idx_request_logs_time` cursor
  with a fixed scan window. A same-user candidate page reports one retention context with cache
  hits for subsequent candidates. Online cleanup must not create or analyze body-specific indexes.
- Online HA outbox GC must use a non-blocking maintenance write lease and a one-second slice
  budget. If the lease or SQLite writer is busy, it must finish the current scheduled row and
  persist a bounded continuation handoff instead of waiting through the scheduler's long retry
  window. A transient handoff conflict keeps only the matching representative claim for a fixed,
  bounded same-generation retry when available, or for claim-fenced stale-reaper recovery; it must
  never create an unbounded background retry loop.
  Productive retention slices whose slowest active database micro-batch stays within `50ms` must persist a
  five-second continuation and adapt their per-channel batch size within `25..250`; an over-budget
  slice halves its next batch before retrying. Legacy-resource cursor verification is not retention
  debt and must continue no faster than five minutes, so a clean large outbox cannot become a
  permanent fast maintenance loop. The five-minute scheduler watchdog may coalesce with the current
  representative when durable GC state reports channel debt. When the mask is empty, it may perform only
  a short controller-state observation-age read; an overdue observation adds its specific channel to
  the pending mask and wakes the normal indexed, admission-gated channel probe rather than scanning an
  outbox in the watchdog. The hourly baseline sweep
  discovers newly expired rows and the watchdog rediscovers both lost continuations and stale empty
  observations within five minutes.
- Per-channel HA GC state must retain cumulative deleted rows, the last high watermark, ingress
  sequence delta, and estimated net-row delta. These are low-cost trend evidence for the read-only
  `ha_outbox_cleanup_once --dry-run` path and must not introduce an online exact `COUNT(*)`.
- HA diagnostic sampling uses an indexed sequence-span estimate with its high watermark rather
  than `COUNT(*)`. A sequence span is an upper bound when deletions leave holes and must be named
  as an estimate.
- Normal online HA GC progress is sampled as one channel-scoped INFO aggregate per 60 seconds;
  slow slices and writer conflicts remain immediate diagnostics.
- With an upstream `/usage` endpoint that hangs past the quota-sync timeout budget, manual and
  scheduler-triggered quota sync runs finish as `error`, leave no long-lived `running` row behind,
  and do not write `api_key_quota_sync_samples` or `api_keys.quota_*`.
- With a stale `quota_sync` or `quota_sync/hot` `running` row older than the configured timeout
  window, the next same-key claim abandons the stale row and starts a fresh run.
- After request-log retention cleanup creates enough freelist pages, DB compaction runs under the
  maintenance gate and reduces the main SQLite file size or reports why compaction was skipped.
- `db_compaction_once --json` reports threshold-based skip vs execution, and `--force` bypasses the
  threshold for a controlled maintenance window.
- `request_logs_gc_once --run-until-complete --json` removes old request logs and catalog rollups
  from a production-derived validation sample and reports `completed=true` when no old rows remain,
  while keeping WAL growth and CPU time bounded.
- A large legacy SQLite DB whose `request_logs` inline sidecar migration would exceed the startup
  budget still starts successfully, keeps `observability.request_logs` attached to the core file,
  and does not create a sibling sidecar file during that startup path.
- `observability_sidecar_migrate --dry-run` reports the core path, sibling sidecar path, sibling
  `observability-migrate.lock` path, whether the service lock is exclusively available, the
  best-effort SQLite write probe result, current attach target, legacy-table presence, fallback
  status, file sizes, and available disk space without creating or attaching a new sidecar file.
  That startup attach probe must match normal startup semantics for existing DBs; only missing or
  mistyped `--db-path` values are allowed to fail before any file creation.
  The write-probe field is best-effort only and must not make `--dry-run` fail on a read-only
  snapshot.
  A missing or mistyped `--db-path` must fail before creating either the core DB file or the
  sibling sidecar file or the sibling `observability-migrate.lock`.
- After `observability_sidecar_migrate` completes on a large legacy sample, the sibling
  `*-observability.db` exists, `main.request_logs` is gone, `observability.request_logs` preserves
  the original `id` coverage, child `request_log_id` / `source_request_log_id` references remain
  valid, and legacy `api_key_usage_buckets`, `dashboard_request_rollup_buckets`, and
  `request_log_catalog_rollups` are removed from `main`. Sidecar `api_key_usage_buckets`,
  `dashboard_request_rollup_buckets`, and `request_log_catalog_rollups` must already be rebuilt,
  their meta keys must be marked complete, the catalog retention meta must match the current
  retention setting, and a fresh normal startup reopen must succeed before the command reports
  `completed=true`.
- The explicit migration path must refuse to run while another process still holds the sibling
  `observability-migrate.lock`; success no longer relies on WAL-mode `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE` semantics to
  infer that the live service has stopped.
- Re-running `observability_sidecar_migrate` after a partial or finished copy must not duplicate
  sidecar `request_logs` rows and must report whether it resumed an earlier copy or found the DB
  already migrated.
- `request_logs_gc_once` can run against that same large legacy single-DB layout without forcing a
  startup-time sidecar split first.
- The current branch must be able to reproduce that explicit migration path on shared testbox from a
  production-shaped cold snapshot, then start normally and pass `/health`, `/api/version`,
  `/api/tavily/search`, `/mcp`, and request-log read-path smoke checks against the migrated data.
- The cutover runbook must be executable as written against the current deployment topology, with a
  local `docker compose` service, host-level `sqlite3`, a writable data mount, and the rollback
  anchor uploaded before the local migration mutates the core DB.
- Existing billing tests continue to prove locked billing subject stability, pending billing
  replay, and account/token quota attribution.
- Existing MCP/API routing behavior remains unchanged, including research result GET key pinning.

## Visual Evidence

- evidence_note: This topic change is limited to SQLite scheduling and persistence behavior. Any
  future UI-affecting change must add current-SHA visual evidence before selecting it for a PR.

## Runtime Boundary

- Reconciliation candidate-query timeouts are recorded as local pressure rather than an empty
  queue, and successful remote observations are finalized within the reserved write tail even when
  a later candidate exhausts the request budget.
- Reconciliation completion markers, run statistics, local-pressure state, and affected-Key cooldown
  state share one bounded post-processing deadline. SQLite contention may produce an explicit
  persistence timeout, but must not leave the worker waiting past the run budget or report a durable
  success without recording the state transition; the deadline must end before the scheduler's outer
  timeout so cancellation cannot race the controlled timeout path. Legacy global-backoff metadata is
  compatibility-only and is never a live reconciliation gate.
- Reconciliation preparation source reads use one fresh native SQLite progress-handler session per
  statement rather than cancellation of the awaiting task. Recent/backlog candidates, candidate and
  billed-credit hydrate, Research candidates, and historical projection source pages have a 250ms
  deadline; a deadline interrupt is `projection_read_budget`, stops later preparation and remote
  work, and atomically schedules the 30-second claim-fenced continuation. Handler cleanup is
  mandatory before returning a connection to the pool.
- A remote admission lease describes only one outbound HTTP attempt. It is not a broad maintenance
  permit and must be released before reconciliation finalization or other SQLite work.
- A reconciliation 429 records only the affected Key cooldown and its claim-fenced continuation;
  the legacy global-backoff metadata is never consulted as a SQLite or scheduler gate.
- Research selection is a bounded indexed source read owned only by the drain: one page contains at
  most 80 due rows. The exact processed `(next_poll_at, key_id, request_id)` cursor, Research outcome,
  and optional Key cooldown commit in one claim-fenced transaction. A read deadline, cancellation,
  or stale claim leaves all three unchanged.
- The unfiltered administrator Events canonical page is a bounded read-only exception to the
  filtered JSON projection builder: it uses the projection time index and decodes materialized
  payloads after the query. Its `100ms` acquire and `250ms` native statement deadline remain fixed;
  a missed deadline is evidence for a separate query-plan task, not a reason to relax this contract.
