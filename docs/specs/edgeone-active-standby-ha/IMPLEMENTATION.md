# Implementation

## Backend

- Online HA GC is admitted as instance-local bulk work. It never takes a process-global
  maintenance gate or a special writer connection; admission pressure and SQLite busy defer only
  the selected channel for 30 seconds, while other eligible channels retain their independent
  controller wake time.

- Ordinary administrator HA status reads `HaPeerObservationStore`; the background owner probes every 30 seconds with a five-second timeout, retains last-good observations, and marks them stale after 90 seconds without success. Dangerous control-plane operations continue to probe live.
- Online outbox GC persists independent control, billing, and runtime eligibility plus claim generation. Round-robin selection skips deferred channels, and the scheduler uses the earliest typed continuation instead of parsing GC log text.
- `HaGcController` now makes the per-channel durable row the single source of scheduling truth. A
  five-minute legacy scan, slow SQL, or SQLite-busy defer remains attached to that channel while the
  next eligible channel receives the next fair writer slice. Completion is fenced by the channel
  claim generation and records the next wake atomically.
- During five minutes of foreground traffic at or below `5 rps`, controller recovery uses one
  channel-scoped slice per second until debt clears. Ordinary draining remains on a five-second
  cadence; foreground pressure, a busy writer, or a batch over the 50ms target moves only that
  channel to the 30-second defer path.

- Added `src/ha.rs` with HA mode, role state machine, runtime status view, and Tencent TC3-signed EdgeOne client calls.
- Added HA startup role detection from EdgeOne current origin.
- Added dual-active leader-key startup seeding and authority refresh through `meta.ha_full_master_node_id_v1`, so `HA_CORE_DUAL_ACTIVE=1` with `HA_SOURCE_KIND=origin_group` uses the persisted leader key instead of treating the current EdgeOne route as the only serving authority.
- Added runtime EdgeOne authority refresh so a running old active enters `recovery` when the origin moves away, and an externally pointed standby only becomes `provisional_master` until administrator finalize.
- Added HA peer inventory parsing through `HA_PEER_NODES_JSON`, real admin `peerNodes[]` aggregation, internal-only peer status/finalize/query endpoints, and `planned cutover` orchestration initiated from the current `full_master` or the current leader key depending on route family.
- Active-standby status now exposes the configured remote `peerCount` and a
  `syncDisabledReason=no_configured_peers` diagnostic when no usable synchronization path exists.
  Legacy `HA_SYNC_SOURCE_URL` pull sync remains a valid path outside dual-active mode, but dual-active
  mode requires a configured peer. The peer-sync task logs that startup state once and remains
  disabled instead of emitting a repeating sync failure; health and local role semantics are unchanged.
- Extended admin HA peer aggregation so each `peerNodes[]` item carries both `publicOrigin` and `sourceConfigTarget`, letting the node inventory render the configured source target instead of mixing live EdgeOne target and peer direct-entry labels in the same “源站” column.
- Narrowed `GET /api/admin/ha/nodes/:node_id` to the selected peer, `currentNodeId`, and their
  interaction timeline. The endpoint no longer serializes current-node EdgeOne or source-setting
  fields, and its response boundary has a regression test.
- Added normalized HA control-plane timeline storage through `ha_control_plane_events`, admin timeline query, and hourly 7-day retention GC.
- Replaced SQLite snapshot export/import with deprecated `410 Gone` responses so HA cannot transfer full database files.
- Added admin/internal endpoints for HA status, zstd NDJSON state baseline, zstd NDJSON outbox events, event acknowledgement, promote, finalize, and recovery import.
- Added per-node HA source settings persistence and admin API so the current instance can store a private source override, switch between direct origin and source group, and optionally apply the saved source to EdgeOne immediately. The startup config now also accepts `HA_SOURCE_KIND` and `HA_SOURCE_ORIGIN_GROUP_ID` as per-node defaults, while `EDGEONE_EXPECTED_ORIGIN_*` stays direct-origin only.
- Hardened HA startup restore ordering so persisted node-local source settings are restored before the first EdgeOne startup authority check and before the startup HA snapshot is rewritten. This keeps a saved direct-origin override authoritative across restarts instead of letting the Env default source overwrite it.
- Hardened runtime EdgeOne authority parsing so `DescribeAccelerationDomains` merges the outer domain record's `OriginProtocol` / `HttpOriginPort` / `HttpsOriginPort` into `OriginDetail` before comparing the live target against this node's effective source settings. This keeps an active node from being mis-demoted to `recovery` when EdgeOne reports a custom direct-origin port such as `:1443` only on the outer record.
- Locked the HA source settings request/response wire contract to lowercase `directOriginScheme` values (`http|https|follow`) by adding serde lowercase support on the shared Rust enum, while preserving the existing uppercase conversion for outbound EdgeOne payloads.
- Added standby pull-based sync controlled by `HA_SYNC_SOURCE_URL`, `HA_INTERNAL_TOKEN`, and `HA_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECS`; active nodes no longer push snapshots.
- Added peer lookup fallback for `mcp_sessions` and `research_requests`, with local-first lookups, a five-second total budget, and deterministic miss handling so the service can either resume the original session/key binding or fail without guessing a new key.
- Reworked HA baseline export so active nodes stream zstd NDJSON directly from SQLite rows instead
  of materializing one giant baseline string before compression. The same active baseline route is
  now used for `billing_ledger`, so repeated billing baseline exports do not recreate the previous
  multi-GiB memory spike on the primary.
- Added default structured HA perf events around baseline/events export + import + standby sync so
  operators can read `elapsed_ms`, `row_count`, `payload_bytes`, `compressed_bytes`, and runtime
  memory headroom directly from the default stderr logs without enabling a second telemetry system.
- Reworked standby baseline/events import so node-to-node sync consumes `reqwest` byte streams
  through async zstd decoders and applies records line-by-line inside explicit HA apply sessions.
  Standby no longer buffers the whole response body, decoded blob, or a full in-memory event/baseline
  vector before touching SQLite.
- Split HA apply into session-based incremental baseline/events transactions. This keeps the channel
  transaction semantics while avoiding the previous “parse everything into Vec, then apply” memory
  pattern.
- Added HA-role-aware forward-proxy runtime gating. `HA_MODE=single` keeps the existing eager
  startup behavior, but `active_standby` now defers forward-proxy/xray initialization until the node
  role allows business traffic. `standby`/`recovery` also skip the periodic forward-proxy maintenance
  loop and report `/health=ok` without requiring xray readiness.
- Follow-up health hardening for serving roles keeps that HA carve-out intact: `standby` /
  `recovery` still return `/health=ok` while xray/runtime warmup is intentionally skipped, but a
  role that is currently allowed to serve business traffic no longer reports healthy from the
  forward-proxy startup grace window before xray is actually ready.
- Tightened standby/recovery startup so business background schedulers are role-gated alongside the
  deferred runtime graph. `quota_sync`, usage rollups, request-log/auth-token GC, LinuxDo sync,
  forward-proxy maintenance, and DB compaction no longer enqueue or run on standby startup; only the
  HA sync/authority background path stays active before promotion.
- HA standby sync now flushes persisted node-state/watermark writes between per-channel baseline and
  events apply steps, so the next channel's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction does not race with a
  coalesced state write and reintroduce `database is locked` / nested-transaction failures during
  large baseline catch-up.
- HA standby sync now treats SQLite foreign-key failures during per-channel events apply as a
  broken incremental window for that channel instead of a fatal whole-loop error. When a channel
  hits `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed`, the standby resets that channel's `baseline_applied` and
  `applied_seq` watermarks to `0`, flushes the reset immediately, and lets the next sync interval
  recover through a fresh baseline pull rather than retrying the same invalid event batch forever.
- HA node-state persistence now deduplicates identical coalesced snapshots before writing SQLite.
  This keeps the standby-side EdgeOne authority refresh loop from rewriting the same `ha_node_state`
  row every five seconds while the node stays fenced, which in turn removes the repeated slow
  `INSERT INTO ha_node_state ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` noise observed during `hinet-lam` standby
  smoke runs.
- Replaced the old implicit single-channel HA contract with explicit `control` / `billing` /
  `runtime` channels carried over the same `/api/admin/ha/baseline`, `/api/admin/ha/events`, and
  `/api/admin/ha/events/ack` endpoints via a required `channel` contract.
- Narrowed `ha_outbox` to the `control` channel only. `billing_ledger` now emits into
  `ha_billing_outbox`, while minimal runtime state emits into `ha_runtime_outbox`.
- `HA_MODE=single` now drops all HA replication triggers at startup and does not emit new HA
  events, while preserving schema compatibility for future `active_standby` cold start.
- Added per-channel peer watermark storage keyed by `(peer_node_id, channel)` and a compatibility
  rebuild for old single-column `ha_peer_watermarks` schemas.
- Added bounded `ha_outbox_gc` maintenance with scheduler/manual-job support. The online path owns
  one persisted channel per slice, advances a durable round-robin cursor, and deletes only within
  that channel's retention window. It never runs a WAL checkpoint or full `VACUUM`; the one-shot
  CLI retains the larger bounded maintenance budget.
- Added offline `ha_outbox_cleanup_once` and `scripts/ha-outbox-maintenance.sh` so large retained
  historical `ha_outbox` rows can be cleaned explicitly during a maintenance window before an
  optional `db_compaction_once`.
- Added a dedicated `ha_trigger_repair_once` one-shot CLI and upgraded HA trigger reconcile so an
  upgraded database no longer relies on the current whitelist alone when dropping triggers.
  Startup/manual repair now enumerates `sqlite_master`, removes legacy `trg_ha_outbox_*` leftovers
  that no longer belong to `control/billing/runtime`, then rebuilds only the current three-channel
  contract.
- Added `scripts/export-live-db-snapshot-to-testbox.sh` so operators can export the full live
  SQLite validation input from 101 into an isolated `codex-testbox` run directory. The script is
  intentionally sidecar-aware and treats the validation input as a set:
  - core DB snapshot for `tavily_proxy.db`
  - observability sibling snapshot for `tavily_proxy-observability.db`
  - per-run manifest with source paths, byte counts, SHA-256 sums, and integrity-check results
- The accepted offline validation sequence is now explicit:
  1. create a full read-only snapshot set on 101
  2. upload that full set into one `codex-testbox` run directory
  3. run `ha_trigger_repair_once` or `ha_outbox_cleanup_once --repair-triggers` there
  4. run `ha_outbox_cleanup_once` / `scripts/ha-outbox-maintenance.sh` there
  5. run `db_compaction_once` only if the threshold gate says reclaimable space is large enough
- `ha_outbox_cleanup_once` now distinguishes immediate invalid-legacy cleanup from normal retention
  cleanup in its JSON/plain reports, so operators can prove whether the pass is shrinking a stale
  upgraded backlog or only trimming aged rows.
- Online and standalone cleanup reports keep command wall-clock separate from `active_elapsed_ms`
  and `max_batch_elapsed_ms`. The latter two values accumulate actual cleanup batches only,
  excluding configured inter-batch yields and post-slice maintenance probes.
- `ha_outbox_cleanup_once --dry-run` uses a read-only SQLite connection and reports index presence,
  retention, oldest age, watermark, lowest peer ACK, and pending-cleanup state without repairing
  triggers or deleting rows.
- Shared-testbox validation against a full 101 snapshot confirmed the upgraded-database failure
  mode and the repair-first fix:
  - `ha_trigger_repair_once --ha-mode active_standby` dropped `30` legacy single-channel triggers
    before recreating the current `control/billing/runtime` trigger set.
  - `ha_outbox_cleanup_once --repair-triggers --run-until-complete --json` deleted `29,143,494`
    rows in total, including `27,770,036` invalid legacy `ha_outbox` rows and `1,373,458` normal
    retention rows.
  - After cleanup, `ha_outbox` contained only current control resources and shrank to `163,357`
    rows, while `ha_billing_outbox` / `ha_runtime_outbox` stayed at `265,496` / `19,822` rows.
  - The same validation run left `freelist_count=2,951,432`, proving roughly `12 GiB` of
    reclaimable space and confirming that a follow-up compaction is worth running in the real
    maintenance window.
  - `db_compaction_once` on the shared testbox failed with `database or disk is full` because the
    host root filesystem had only about `3.5 GiB` free. That is an environment-capacity blocker,
    not a repair-path failure; production compaction still needs adequate temporary free space.
- “Full live DB validation input” does not mean “copy the main `.db` file only.” For this service
  it means the core DB plus the observability sibling sidecar; otherwise offline verification can
  silently miss the production request-log/read-model layout.
- Added recovery batch idempotency, HA sync watermarks, failover operation persistence, EdgeOne request/response audit persistence, and node state persistence.
- Adjusted EdgeOne origin switching to require explicit origin protocol, host, and port configuration, send them as top-level EdgeOne API fields, and normalize EdgeOne describe responses that omit default ports.
- Updated direct-origin EdgeOne switch payloads to send the provider-compatible `OriginInfo.OriginType=IP_DOMAIN`, and added regression coverage so admin HA source switching no longer sends the rejected lowercase literal.
- Added full-master fencing for system settings, upstream key creation, user token management, user quota changes, registration settings, OAuth login start, recharge order creation, and payment notify.
- Added basic-business fencing for external Tavily HTTP API, MCP root/subpaths, and Tavily usage routes; `standby` and `recovery` return 503 before auth/quota/upstream work.
- Added dual-active serving eligibility so `standby` can serve core Tavily business when `HA_CORE_DUAL_ACTIVE=1` and the node is on an origin-group route, while `recovery` remains fenced and control-plane writes stay on `full_master`.
- Restricted dual-active `promote` to explicit `force=true` takeover and reject it when any reachable peer still allows full writes, so routine leader changes must use `planned cutover`.
- Restricted non-force promote to `standby` callers so an active node cannot demote itself through an accidental promote operation.
- Added HA schema tables for node state, sync watermarks, failover operations, recovery batches, and EdgeOne audit logs.
- Extended HA node state storage with direct-origin and source-group columns so the current instance can override the Env/CLI default source without joining HA sync.
- Recovery import now rejects request/auth-token log payloads and accepts only mergeable ledger-style payloads, keeping the importing new master in its current active role.

## Frontend

- The TypeScript HA client now treats the four topology diagnostics as optional wire fields and
  normalizes every status-producing API response through one boundary. Rolling upgrades default
  missing values to `false`, `null`, `peerNodes.length`, and `null`, while current server values
  remain authoritative.
- The administrator HA page shows the core mode, control-plane leader, and configured peer count.
  `no_configured_peers` also raises the compact Dashboard attention state; unknown disable reasons
  map to generic localized guidance instead of rendering backend detail. User-facing HA banners do
  not consume these administrator diagnostics.

## 2026-08-02 self-healing GC status

- `HaChannelHealth` and `HaNodeDetailPanel` now display per-channel debt mode, observed timestamp,
  oldest deletable age, deletion rate, foreground RPS, SLO state, recovery deadline, adaptive batch,
  and defer/next-retry context for control, billing, and runtime.
- The Storybook fixtures cover normal, recovering, foreground-pressure, deferred, baseline-required,
  and stalled channel states without changing the public HA status contract.

- Added API bindings for HA status, promote, and finalize.
- Added shared `HaStatusBanner` with admin and user presentation modes.
- Added admin HA service node panel with active-standby status details, including node inventory, role, origin, health, EdgeOne domain/current/expected origin, EdgeOne API configuration, sync timestamps, basic traffic/full write gates, recovery status, message, and row-level promote/finalize actions.
- Reworked the HA settings page into a control plane that reads real `peerNodes[]`, exposes planned-cutover actions for eligible standby candidates, and shows a 7-day timeline with collapsible technical details.
- Moved the full admin HA panel into the System Settings high-availability subpage at `/admin/system-settings/ha`; normal admin business pages no longer render HA UI, and abnormal states only render a compact link to the HA settings page.
- Added promote/finalize actions for degraded admin states inside the HA settings page only.
- Added user console banner for degraded HA states.
- Added Storybook scenarios for provisional, standby, full master, recovery, compact admin attention, System Settings high availability, and user degraded states.
- Added i18n-backed HA service-node copy for zh/en, plus a source-configuration dialog on the System Settings high-availability page and Storybook/tests that no longer hardcode English text.
- Scoped `HaNodeDetailPanel` to the selected peer by removing the local EdgeOne settings and
  operations-context cards. The current-node relationship remains in the introduction and timeline;
  source configuration remains available only from the HA overview.
- Added a local shadcn-style `Alert` primitive and upgraded the HA source settings dialog submit-failure state to use a destructive alert with operator-friendly titles, concise recovery guidance, and default-collapsed technical details. Field-level validation remains attached to the relevant direct/origin-group inputs instead of collapsing into a single raw error block.

## Visual Evidence

- Storybook canvas: `Components/HaStatusBanner/SourceDialogSubmitFailure`
  - evidence_note: The submit-failure story now actively triggers the failed `保存并切换 EdgeOne 到此源站` path and renders the formal destructive alert with a stronger clay-native error peak, mode-specific recovery guidance, auto-focus on the failure region, a clearer raw-response disclosure, and de-emphasized footer actions while the failure is present. The captured dialog screenshot is stored at `docs/specs/edgeone-active-standby-ha/assets/ha-source-dialog-submit-failure-alert.png`, measured `672x952`, and bound to `60388584700da855bb1e015402aab9baa4951314`. `trim_whitespace.py` re-ran and reported `no_meaningful_whitespace`, so the original crop remained canonical.
- web demo: `http://127.0.0.1:12400/admin/system-settings/ha?demo=1`
  - evidence_note: The HA node inventory now renders node names as explicit links, and clicking `demo-standby` opens `/admin/system-settings/ha/nodes/demo-standby` with node metadata plus the last 7 days of interaction logs merged with operation-linked EdgeOne audit events. Desktop and mobile captures are stored at `docs/specs/edgeone-active-standby-ha/assets/ha-node-detail-web-demo-desktop.png` and `docs/specs/edgeone-active-standby-ha/assets/ha-node-detail-web-demo-mobile.png`. `trim_whitespace.py` was executed for both raw captures and returned `action=unchanged` with `reason=ambiguous_border`, so the raw crop remains the canonical final evidence.

- Shared `codex-testbox` Docker Compose harness with Rust mock EdgeOne, Rust mock ingress, dual app nodes, and Rust mock Tavily upstream:
  `legacy_pre -> legacy_failover -> legacy_recovery -> dual_active_serving -> dual_active_cutover -> memory`.

## Integration Harness

- Added `tests/ha/Dockerfile.mock` plus Rust mock binaries:
  `mock_tavily`, `mock_edgeone`, and `mock_edgeone_ingress`.
- Reworked `tests/ha/docker-compose.yml` into a shared base that uses bind-mounted runtime dirs
  instead of named volumes.
- Added `tests/ha/docker-compose.legacy.yml` for `HA_SOURCE_KIND=direct`,
  `HA_CORE_DUAL_ACTIVE=0`.
- Added `tests/ha/docker-compose.dual-active.yml` for `HA_SOURCE_KIND=origin_group`,
  `HA_SOURCE_ORIGIN_GROUP_ID=og-core`, `HA_CORE_DUAL_ACTIVE=1`.
- Replaced the old staged acceptance flow with
  `legacy_pre`, `legacy_failover`, `legacy_recovery`, `dual_active_serving`, and
  `dual_active_cutover`.
- The harness no longer uses a dedicated `ha-test-runner` container. SQLite fixture seeding,
  acceptance checks, and memory-contract assertions all run host-side against bind-mounted runtime
  dirs.
- Added `tests/ha/scripts/run_testbox_ha_suite.sh` for remote single-run orchestration and
  `scripts/run-ha-testbox-suite.sh` as the local shared-testbox wrapper.
- Added `tests/ha/README.md` documenting local usage, suite matrix, runtime-dir layout, and
  harness-only headers.
- Hardened the test-only Dockerfiles so `tests/ha/Dockerfile.app` and `tests/ha/Dockerfile.mock`
  reuse their Rust builder stage as the runtime image. This keeps the shared testbox from doing a
  second external `debian:bookworm-slim` metadata resolution on every overlay rebuild and removes a
  flaky Docker Hub EOF class from the acceptance path.
- The harness uses only mock upstreams and runs on `codex-testbox`; it does not call the
  production Tavily or EdgeOne endpoints.
- Added `tests/ha/docker-compose.memory.yml`, `tests/ha/scripts/seed_large_ha_fixture.py`,
  `tests/ha/scripts/run_ha_memory_contract.py`, and
  `tests/ha/scripts/run_testbox_ha_memory_contract.sh` for the 256MiB cgroup contract. The accepted
  proof seeds a production-shaped HA fixture, forces both app services under `mem_limit: 256m`,
  waits for standby catch-up, then repeatedly hits the active `billing` baseline export while
  sampling `memory.current`.
- Shared-testbox proof result:
  - final passing run: `20260701_155428_052e29f6_ha_suite`
  - remote run dir:
    `/srv/codex/workspaces/ivan/tavily-hikari__e8e88f26/runs/20260701_155428_052e29f6_ha_suite`
  - local artifact mirror:
    `.tmp/ha-testbox-20260701_155428_052e29f6_ha_suite`
  - suite status summary:
    - `legacy.status = 0`
    - `dualActive.status = 0`
    - `memory.status = 0`
  - dual-active serving proof:
    - `node-a` stayed `full_master`, `node-b` stayed serving `standby`
    - the same ingress domain served `/mcp`, `/api/tavily/search|extract|crawl|map|research`, and
      `/api/tavily/usage` from both nodes
    - cross-node MCP follow-up reused the original `upstream-mock-session-1`
    - cross-node research result fetch kept the original bound key `tvly-node-a-seed`
  - dual-active cutover proof:
    - `dual_active_cutover.json` recorded `nodeA=standby`, `nodeB=full_master`
    - EdgeOne source remained `origin_group=og-core`; cutover only changed the leader key
    - `POST /api/admin/ha/finalize` stayed rejected with `409` in dual-active mode
  - memory contract proof:
    - `nodeAPeakMemoryCurrent = 82,968,576`
    - `nodeBPeakMemoryCurrent = 268,427,264`
    - `nodeAOomKilled = false`
    - `nodeBOomKilled = false`
    - standby converged to `users=2000`, `tokens=2000`, `sessions=3000`, `billing=35000`
- Online `ha_outbox_gc` now reuses the running application's `TavilyProxy` pool, acquires a
  non-blocking maintenance write lease, and runs at most `250 x 4` rows within one second with
  100ms inter-batch yielding. Busy, incomplete, or lease-deferred slices finish their job and
  persist a 30-second continuation; the independent CLI retains its `20,000 x 8 / 20s` budget.
- Control retention remains 72 hours while billing/runtime retention is 14 days. Peer-less export
  diagnostics report a null ACK lag, and the admin node view now exposes per-channel ACK and GC
  health without a `COUNT(*)` query.
- Per-channel GC state now persists attempts, progress, batch size, defer reason, and retry time.
  Administrator peer details expose those fields beside ACK health; continuation persistence has no
  unbounded retry task and relies on generation-safe stale recovery. If that persistence falls
  back, it atomically records the selected channel in the global pending-debt mask with the channel
  defer state, so the five-minute watchdog can recover the work even from an otherwise clean mask.
- Productive retention cleanup now persists a five-second continuation while its slowest active
  SQLite micro-batch stays within a 50ms target. Slow work, busy writers, and lease deferrals retain the 30-second
  delay; a valid-only legacy cursor scan remains on a five-minute cadence so compatibility cleanup
  cannot create a permanent online write loop. The hourly baseline discovers newly expired rows;
  the five-minute watchdog resumes pending debt and adds stale or unobserved channels to the current fair
  probe set even when another channel remains active, without an outbox scan. Only a probe that confirms
  remaining work persists a debt bit, so an empty unknown channel cannot create a fast wake loop. Per-channel state records
  high-watermark deltas, an ingress-minus-delete estimate, and cumulative deletions without a
  hot-path `COUNT(*)`.
- The CI shard manifest assigns `online_ha_gc_*` watchdog-debt regression coverage to `lib-misc`.
  `ci_backend_tests.py verify` requires every discovered backend test to have exactly one shard
  owner, so the continuation-recovery regression cannot silently disappear from the PR matrix.

## Current diagnostics contract

- The scheduler emits one sampled `ha_outbox_gc` aggregate INFO per channel per 60-second window. Slow slices and SQLite conflicts bypass the normal window so they remain immediately visible without restoring per-slice WARN noise.
- The administrator channel health projection carries controller-owned eligibility, next wake,
  claim-fenced progress, ingress and net-row estimates, deletion rate, batch size, and defer reason.
  Empty, unavailable, and legacy peer values render as explicit unknown coverage rather than a
  fabricated healthy zero.
- Sampled HA export/sync logs publish indexed `outbox_sequence_span_estimate` and high watermark
  instead of an exact outbox row count. Sequence holes make the span an estimate, not inventory.
- Reconciliation local-pressure metadata is part of the replicated HA meta set. The final deadline
  split also keeps durable reconciliation markers within the same bounded run as remote observations.
