# Implementation：性能诊断日志与低内存稳定运行合同（#m2p6k）

## 当前状态

- 状态：渐进实现中（SQLite containment slice 待最终验证）

## 已落地实现

- `sqlite_workload_window` now aggregates workload class, operation, admission decisions and defer
  reason, pool/begin waits, transaction hold time, rows, busy/timeout outcomes, acquire waiters,
  minimum idle capacity, connection-scoped `CACHE_WRITE` pages, and cooperative read deadlines.
  Process/cgroup write-byte deltas remain explicitly aggregate labels. Normal operations stay DEBUG;
  the window emits at most one INFO record per minute, while sustained pressure and recovery use
  state transitions.
- The runtime reads `/proc` and cgroup I/O only for a window emission, slow/error path, or state
  transition. The aggregation never includes SQL, parameters, request bodies, or credentials.
- A low-pressure GC slice may request allocator trimming only after the connection closes, and the
  process-wide request is rate-limited to one attempt per five minutes. The trim duration is DEBUG
  diagnostic data, so debt recovery cannot turn allocator maintenance into a per-slice CPU cost.

- 默认 runtime logging 继续沿用现有 JSON stderr 与 `RUNTIME_LOG_FORMAT=text` fallback，
  没有引入第二套 telemetry。
- 新增 `RuntimeMemorySnapshot` 与 `RuntimePerfScope`，默认事件可采集：
  - `memory_current_bytes`
  - `memory_limit_bytes`
  - `headroom_bytes`
  - `process_rss_bytes`
  - `child_process_rss_bytes`
  - `process_group_rss_bytes`
  - `process_hwm_bytes`
  - `process_swap_bytes`
- HA 读写链路已补结构化 perf 事件：
  - baseline/events export
  - baseline/events import
  - standby baseline/events sync
  - 三路 channel 的 `outbox_row_count / oldest_age / ack_lag` 只读观测
- HA perf events now use per-`(event, channel)` sampling: ordinary completions are DEBUG with a
  once-per-minute INFO sample, while outbox aggregation plus full runtime-memory capture is
  limited to once per channel every five minutes or occurs immediately for slow work. This keeps
  the diagnostic fields available without adding read pressure on each polling pass. DEBUG samples
  retain source, peer, watermark, cursor, and detail fields so an operator can still trace normal
  synchronization progress without enabling the expensive aggregate collection.
- HA cleanup timing keeps command wall-clock distinct from active cleanup time and the slowest
  cleanup batch. The offline command excludes configured yields and post-cleanup overhead from its
  batch metrics, so its diagnostics remain comparable to the online slice contract.
- SQLx slow-statement emission uses DEBUG instead of WARN. Default runtime logs retain structured
  operation timing/errors without complete statement text; an explicit `sqlx::query=debug` filter
  restores SQL-level diagnostics.
- owner-facing 重读路径已补结构化 perf 事件：
  - dashboard overview
  - startup dashboard overview prewarm / deferred
  - dashboard shared snapshot cache-hit / rebuild
  - dashboard phase-level 事件：`freshness_probe` / `cache_wait` / `quota_charge_rebuild` / `recent_alerts_rebuild` / `overview_payload_build` / `overview_serialize`
  - alerts phase-level 事件：`alerts_projection` / `alerts_grouping`
  - global/key request logs catalog / list
  - token request logs catalog / list
- forward-proxy/xray 启动关键阶段已补结构化 perf 事件：
  - runtime begin
  - snapshot persisted
  - store synced
- owner-facing 重读路径新增默认 `low_memory_protection_decision` 事件，用来记录当前判定
  verdict；PR1 阶段先记录既有 `full/cache_hit/rebuilt` 语义，不改变业务响应。
- `low_memory_protection_decision` 已增加 30 秒重复采样抑制，相同 verdict 不再连续刷默认 INFO。
- request logs / token logs 的 perf 完成事件默认走 `INFO` 级别，避免把正常诊断事件误打成
  `WARN`。
- 新增日志单测，直接断言 perf 事件包含稳定字段、phase/outbox 字段与内存预算字段，并确认 `INFO` 级输出可解析。
- `RuntimePerfScope` 延迟到真正输出日志时才读取 footprint；INFO 采样五分钟复用快照，slow/error
  立即采集。cgroup anon/file/swap 与进程 RssAnon/RssFile/VmSwap 分开输出。
- 在线 HA GC、对账和调度恢复现已由结构化状态跃迁日志覆盖；普通切片、phase、逐 key 429 与
  enqueue reuse 不再逐次输出 INFO/WARN。
- `SqliteRuntime` 使用 60 秒有界 operation/class window 汇总 pool/begin wait、transaction hold、
  affected rows、错误和丢弃连接，并仅在窗口边界读取 process/cgroup write bytes。普通成功和重试不
  逐次输出，连接污染与最终错误立即可见。
- The workload window includes bounded derived-observability flushes. Server-pressure and rebalance
  audit defer/retry events stay DEBUG, while stale/recovered coverage changes and fixed transport
  categories are safe owner-facing diagnostics without SQL, request bodies, endpoints, or tokens.
- Administrator privacy status uses an AppState-owned immutable last-good controller with one
  refresh flight. Ready startup schedules a non-blocking retrying prewarm; requests copy cached
  data rather than building the status synchronously. An expired cached value returns fixed-reason
  stale coverage while the controller refreshes or defers, and a true cold miss returns
  `503 Retry-After: 1`. Administrator alert Events, Groups, and Catalog use a normalized
  exact-query cache with a five-minute cap; a bounded read may return the matching stale entry,
  while a cold key returns `503 Retry-After: 1` rather than waiting for a raw alert CTE.
- Server-pressure rebuilds are source-fenced and hysteretic: ordinary deferred deltas do not start
  a rebuild, while overflow, lost coverage, or five minutes of continuous stale state may start at
  most one generation every five minutes. Rebuild slices remain bounded and replayable from the
  request-log source.
- Privacy status refresh acquires one dedicated read snapshot within 100ms and constructs its full
  immutable result on that connection outside the HTTP path. Its `BEGIN` uses the connection-local
  100ms busy timeout rather than task cancellation, restoring the connection to the pool on
  contention. The refresh closes explicitly before its result is published, so request timeouts
  never discard an open read snapshot. It bypasses
  maintenance-bulk admission; cached reads return stale coverage during pressure or refresh, while
  true cold reads return `503 Retry-After: 1`.
- Server-pressure recovery allocates a staged generation, aggregates fixed-fence 500-row keyset
  slices, publishes once, and removes obsolete buckets in 25-row cleanup slices. Direct deltas and
  buffered tail replay always write the active generation, so source rebuilds do not amplify normal
  business writes or expose a partial live series.
- Schema migration emits fixed `component/event/outcome/elapsed_ms` fields for baseline adoption and warm verification. GC and reconciliation keep normal work at DEBUG, aggregate INFO to one-minute windows, and reserve WARN/INFO for state transitions.

## 剩余缺口

- 需要在当前最终 SHA 运行全量验证，并补齐管理员 HA/对账 Storybook 的新视觉证据。
- HA outbox 观测现已覆盖在线 self-healing 的累计与最慢 cleanup micro-batch SQL 耗时、续片延迟、累计删除、高水位增量与
  ingress-minus-delete 估算；后置状态 probe 不参与批次耗时。它们不能替代精确库存统计，但可低成本确认过期债务是否持续前移。
- Deferred-continuation diagnostics share one durable transaction with the selected channel's
  pending-debt bit. A cleared global mask therefore cannot suppress the watchdog signal for a
  failed continuation write, while normal clean-state polling remains quiet.
- HA export/sync 的低频样本使用 `outbox_sequence_span_estimate` 和 `outbox_high_watermark`，不再对每个通道
  执行 `COUNT(*)` 或把近似 span 标成精确 `outbox_row_count`。

- HA perf events retain stable structured fields while avoiding false ACK lag: outbox stats only
  compute lag when a peer watermark is supplied, and the admin health path uses watermark plus
  indexed `EXISTS` checks instead of row counts.

## Reconciliation pressure telemetry

- Reconciliation persists cooldown state per `period_reconciliation` Key. A real upstream 429 uses
  the `5/10/20/30` minute ladder (honoring `Retry-After`) only for the affected Key; other Keys
  remain eligible, and an all-Key cooldown defers to the earliest retry time. Legacy global-backoff
  meta remains readable for rolling compatibility but is not a live gate or representative wake
  source. Normal per-Key cooldown logs are DEBUG; only Key state transitions are summarized at WARN.

## Low-cost memory and transition telemetry

- INFO memory collection is cached for five minutes; slow and error paths bypass the cache.
- cgroup anon/file/swap and process RssAnon/RssFile/VmSwap are reported separately.
- Normal HA slices, dashboard phases, and per-key rate limits are DEBUG; actionable states emit only
  enter, escalation, and recovery transitions.

## Current diagnostics contract

- Online HA GC emits a channel-scoped aggregate INFO at most once per 60 seconds; slow slices and writer conflicts bypass that window. The aggregate reports deletion progress and age, while sequence span remains explicitly an estimate.
- The GC aggregate and administrator channel view now expose controller-owned `next_wake`,
  eligibility, batch size, ingress delta, net-row estimate, deletion rate, last progress and defer
  reason. Normal slices and duplicate continuation attempts remain DEBUG; only state transitions,
  SLO breach/recovery, busy defers and real errors are elevated.
- Reconciliation local-budget pressure is stored and logged independently from upstream 429 backoff, preventing a local query-budget exhaustion from generating a remote-rate-limit alert.
- Reconciliation aggregates include main-settlement and research timing plus typed outcome counts,
  including `no_adjustment`. The status view keeps unknown coverage nullable instead of publishing a
  zero queue or zero adjustment count before its first durable observation.
- Main settlement and Research now use separate durable jobs. The Research drain aggregates one
  poll at a time, while its outcome and exact cursor share one claim-fenced write. HA metadata carries local pressure across
  takeover without increasing normal log volume.
- Research drain observations now separate `pollable` pending rows from `unavailable` 404 rows and
  expose credential-cooling Key counts with the earliest retry in the existing bounded status
  projection. Credential cooldown is independent of per-Key 429 cooldown; raw request identifiers,
  keys, URLs, bodies, and secrets remain excluded.
- Research runtime diagnostics additionally aggregate accepted-continuation reasons
  (`foreground_pressure`, `remote_lease`, `read_budget`, and `control_defer`), the bounded lease
  wait signal, longest eligible wait, and last accepted poll. They do not turn a defer or stale
  claim into progress, terminal, cursor, or Key-state evidence.

## Visual Evidence

PR: include

![Historical system status reconciliation pressure fixture](./assets/system-status-global-reconciliation-backoff.png)

- Storybook canvas: `Admin/Modules/SystemStatusModule/GlobalBackoff`
- evidence_note: Historical mock-only system-status fixture retained for compatibility documentation;
  it is not a live reconciliation gate. Current runtime status uses per-Key cooldown and an earliest
  retry time.
