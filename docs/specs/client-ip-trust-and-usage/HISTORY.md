# History

- 2026-05-08: Added spec for trusted client IP parsing, 7-day distinct IP usage, and admin confirmation UI.
- 2026-05-08: Kept default trusted proxy CIDRs loopback-only so private-network direct clients cannot spoof client IP headers unless an admin explicitly trusts those proxy ranges.
- 2026-05-08: Denied sensitive header names in trusted client IP header settings so diagnostic snapshots cannot persist request secrets through operator typo.
- 2026-05-10: Moved historical `request_user_id` backfill out of startup after
  the `v0.47.0` production rollout exceeded Dockrev's healthcheck window on a
  million-row `request_logs` database; repair now runs through a resumable batch
  CLI.
- 2026-05-12: Extended the admin IP usage contract with 24-hour distinct counts,
  a global UI-only IP warning threshold, and user-detail 7-day IP timeline/list
  visibility.
- 2026-05-12: Filtered empty rebalance local MCP control-plane rows out of the
  observed client IP diagnostic endpoint so downstream/API/tool samples remain
  visible.
- 2026-05-13: Changed the trusted client IP settings dialog to use explicit
  Apply/Cancel closure only, with the default close affordance hidden to keep
  the draft state isolated until confirmation.
- 2026-05-17: Fixed admin user IP statistics reads after production showed
  SQLite choosing the visibility/time index for recent 7-day IP aggregation on
  a large `request_logs` table. Count, address sample, and timeline queries now
  force the existing user/IP/time index and carry query-plan regression tests.
