# ADR 0004: Research Uses an Independent Durable Drain

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ADR 0003 reserved a tail of each main reconciliation run for terminal Research polling. That
bounded the tail, but did not guarantee progress when main multi-Key work repeatedly consumed its
two-request allowance before the Research phase. Research already has a durable v21 selector and
stable cursor, so tying its liveness to the main run is unnecessary.

## Decision

- `upstream_reconciliation_research_drain` is the single production owner of Research polling and
  the v21 scan cursor. The main claimed reconciliation path never sends Research HTTP requests.
- The drain processes at most one candidate and schedules its next normal run no earlier than five
  seconds later. It shares the instance-wide single actual-request lease. After 120 eligible
  seconds it receives its own aged turn and competes with aged main reconciliation by oldest
  eligibility, with main winning an exact tie; manual work remains first.
- The durable `scheduled_jobs.queued_at` value remains the Research fairness anchor across
  foreground, lease, read-budget, and control defers. An accepted poll or a Key cooldown starts a
  new interval, so only continuously requestable work reaches the one-poll foreground exception.
- A claim-fenced control transaction accepts the Research result, any affected
  `period_reconciliation` Key cooldown, the exact processed cursor, and the drain observation
  together. Cancellation, stale claims, and local pressure advance none of them.
- Selection applies the same closed-period eligibility before the 80-row limit and during hydrate.
  Only an actually processed candidate advances the cursor. A five-minute forced wrap rediscovers
  dynamically eligible rows behind the cursor; accepting the forced page refreshes the sweep clock
  in the same transaction so the selector does not repeatedly rescan the prefix.
- A Key-level `429` affects only that Key. Other due Keys remain selectable; when every due Key is
  cooling, a separate bounded lookup wakes the representative at the globally earliest eligible
  cooldown expiry rather than the earliest value in the current cursor page.
- Startup, the stale-job watchdog, and a safely completed main run ensure the unique drain
  representative. Research no longer contributes to the main representative's continuation time.
- The accepted drain transaction also writes its ten-minute progress window and finishes or
  enqueues the unique next representative. Logs and runtime counters are emitted only from that
  accepted receipt, so a stale claim or failed transaction cannot create false convergence evidence.
- `foreground_rps` is only an instance-local recent-request heuristic. A normal drain yields for
  30 seconds above five requests per second; its aged turn may bypass this one heuristic for a
  single poll but cannot bypass SQLite admission, the one-request lease, claim fencing, or the
  short control transaction. Lease contention defers for five seconds without consuming the turn.
  Once that continuation is accepted, its aged reservation remains assigned to Research until a
  resumed run actually begins HTTP, so ordinary automatic jobs cannot take the released lease first,
  although their local preparation may still proceed. The reservation ID, owner kind, and resumable
  flag form one synchronized lifecycle, so clearing an old turn cannot corrupt a newer reservation.
- The administrator Alerts canonical warm path is independent of this drain. Its indexed Events read
  and cache publication do not consume the Research request turn, alter drain fairness, or change any
  reconciliation outcome.

## Consequences

- Main work keeps its complete two-request budget, while due Research has an independent liveness
  path capped at 12 polls per minute with burst one.
- Research separates `foreground_pressure`, `remote_lease`, `read_budget`, and `control_defer`
  continuations. None advances the cursor, writes a poll outcome, affects Key cooldowns, or counts
  as terminal progress.
- Research outcome and cursor acceptance no longer form two transactions.
- Existing v21 tables and indexes are sufficient; no schema migration or historical replay is
  required.
- ADR 0003's reserved-tail scheduling decision is superseded. Its requirement that main results be
  durable before optional follow-up remains satisfied because production Research is now a separate
  claimed job.
