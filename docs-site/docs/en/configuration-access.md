# Configuration & Access

This page is not just an environment-variable list. It answers three practical questions:

1. which settings are the minimum for this deployment
2. how admins are supposed to get in
3. which token downstream clients should actually use

## Start by choosing an access model

Tavily Hikari has two different access layers:

- admin access: who may enter `/admin` and call admin endpoints such as `/api/keys`
- user / client access: who may call `/mcp` or `/api/tavily/*`

Recommended defaults:

- local development: `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true`
- self-hosted single instance: built-in admin login
- production gateway: ForwardAuth
- end-user sign-in: Linux DO OAuth only when needed

## Core runtime settings

No matter which access model you choose, these settings are the main runtime contract:

| Flag / Env                        | Usually matters | Purpose                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `--upstream` / `TAVILY_UPSTREAM`  | yes             | Tavily MCP upstream URL         |
| `TAVILY_USAGE_BASE`               | yes             | Tavily HTTP / usage base URL    |
| `--bind` / `PROXY_BIND`           | yes             | listen address                  |
| `--port` / `PROXY_PORT`           | yes             | listen port                     |
| `--db-path` / `PROXY_DB_PATH`     | yes             | SQLite database path            |
| `LOW_QUOTA_DEPLETION_THRESHOLD`   | optional        | low-balance 432 key threshold   |
| `--static-dir` / `WEB_STATIC_DIR` | depends         | frontend static asset directory |
| `--keys` / `TAVILY_API_KEYS`      | optional        | one-time key bootstrap helper   |

Notes:

- `TAVILY_UPSTREAM` has a default and usually does not need to be overridden in local development,
  but you should override it when using a mock, sandbox, or custom upstream.
- `TAVILY_USAGE_BASE` defaults to `https://api.tavily.com` and affects usage / quota sync flows.
- `TAVILY_UPSTREAM` is treated as the full MCP endpoint. If your reverse proxy preserves a path
  prefix, include the final `/mcp` path in the configured URL.
- `TAVILY_USAGE_BASE` may also include a path prefix. Hikari appends `/search`, `/extract`,
  `/crawl`, `/map`, `/research`, `/research/{id}`, and `/usage` under that prefix.
- `LOW_QUOTA_DEPLETION_THRESHOLD` defaults to `15`. When an upstream key returns 432 and its
  latest known remaining credits are at or below this value, Hikari keeps it out of normal key
  pools for the current UTC month while still allowing it as a final fallback.
- `WEB_STATIC_DIR` is optional. If omitted, the app will try to use `web/dist` when that directory
  exists.
- `TAVILY_API_KEYS` is convenient for bootstrapping, but long-term key lifecycle should be managed
  through the admin UI or admin API.

## Minimum config by deployment shape

### Local development

This is the shortest path:

```bash
export DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true
export PROXY_BIND=127.0.0.1
export PROXY_PORT=58087
```

That gives you:

- direct access to admin endpoints
- a quick path to inject the first upstream Tavily key
- local fallback behavior for `/mcp` and `/api/tavily/*` while validating the app

Use this only for local development.

### Self-hosted single instance

If there is no dedicated gateway, the simplest stable setup is the built-in admin login:

```bash
export ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_ENABLED=true
export ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH='<phc-string>'
export ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=false
```

This is the minimum reliable self-hosted setup. The admin signs in through the browser, receives an
HttpOnly cookie session, and then uses `/admin` and the admin API from there.

### Production gateway / zero-trust edge

If you already have a trusted reverse proxy or identity gateway, use ForwardAuth:

```bash
export ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=true
export FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER=Remote-Email
export FORWARD_AUTH_ADMIN_VALUE=admin@example.com
export FORWARD_AUTH_NICKNAME_HEADER=Remote-Name
```

In that model, admin status is derived from the trusted identity header, not from a local cookie.

## Admin access models

### ForwardAuth

This is the recommended production model.

There are only three things that really matter:

1. which header identifies the caller: `FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER`
2. which value is treated as admin: `FORWARD_AUTH_ADMIN_VALUE`
3. whether the reverse proxy actually injects that value into the request

The most common misunderstanding is this:

- `ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=true` is the default
- but if `FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER` is not configured, that does not magically create admin access

In other words, “the switch is on” does not mean “ForwardAuth integration is complete”.

### Built-in admin login

The built-in admin login is a good fit for:

- self-hosted single-instance deployments
- internal deployments
- setups that do not yet have a dedicated ForwardAuth or SSO layer

Required rule:

- once `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_ENABLED=true`
- you must provide either `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD` or `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH`

Recommended rule:

- prefer `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
- avoid keeping `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD` around long-term

Generate a hash like this:

```bash
echo -n 'change-me' | cargo run --quiet --bin admin_password_hash
```

### Node-local Passkeys in HA

Passkey credentials, reset tokens, WebAuthn challenges, and passkey sessions are local to one node.
Give every node a stable identity and HTTPS origin:

```bash
export ADMIN_AUTH_PASSKEY_ENABLED=true
export NODE_ID=tavily-node-a
export NODE_PUBLIC_SCHEME=https
export NODE_PUBLIC_HOST=tavily-node-a.example.com
```

`ADMIN_PASSKEY_RP_ID` and `ADMIN_PASSKEY_RP_ORIGIN` override the derived values. Without overrides,
Hikari derives RP settings from `NODE_PUBLIC_*` and falls back to `EDGEONE_DOMAIN` only when the node
public host is missing. On the target node, generate the bootstrap URL with the same origin:

```bash
tavily-hikari admin passkey reset-url --base-url https://tavily-node-a.example.com
```

The command rejects a base URL whose origin differs from the effective RP origin. A credential from a
different node or RP scope is temporarily disabled, not deleted; restoring the exact prior node/RP
configuration makes it usable again. Upgrade the current `full_master` first, then roll the release
to standby and recovery nodes, and run this local enrollment flow once per node. Legacy global
Passkey records require re-enrollment on each node.

### `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN`

This is the development shortcut:

```bash
export DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true
```

It does two things:

- opens admin access for local validation
- allows local fallback behavior for `/mcp` and `/api/tavily/*` when you are still wiring up the
  real auth path

Do not treat it as a production-grade access model.

## Linux DO OAuth

Linux DO OAuth is only for end-user sign-in. It is not an admin-auth mechanism.

Enable it when you want end users to log in through the web UI and automatically reuse their bound
Hikari token:

```bash
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_ENABLED=true
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID='<client-id>'
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='<client-secret>'
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL='https://<your-host>/auth/linuxdo/callback'
```

Those three values are required together:

- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL`

Other OAuth settings already have defaults and only matter when you need to override provider
endpoints:

- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_USERINFO_URL`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_SCOPE`

Session tuning is also available:

- `USER_SESSION_MAX_AGE_SECS`
- `OAUTH_LOGIN_STATE_TTL_SECS`

If Linux DO OAuth stays disabled, admins can still issue tokens manually for downstream clients.

## Linux.do Credit recharge payments

Linux.do Credit recharge lets signed-in Linux DO users buy additional monthly quota from the user
console. It depends on Linux DO OAuth because every recharge order is attached to a logged-in local
user account.

Minimum payment config:

```bash
export LINUXDO_CREDIT_ENABLED=true
export LINUXDO_CREDIT_CLIENT_ID='<linuxdo-credit-client-id>'
export LINUXDO_CREDIT_CLIENT_SECRET='<linuxdo-credit-client-secret>'
export LINUXDO_CREDIT_MERCHANT_PRIVATE_KEY='<ed25519-private-key>'
export LINUXDO_CREDIT_NOTIFY_URL='https://<your-host>/api/linuxdo-credit/notify'
export LINUXDO_CREDIT_RETURN_URL='https://<your-host>/console/dashboard'
```

Required values:

- `LINUXDO_CREDIT_ENABLED`
- `LINUXDO_CREDIT_CLIENT_ID`
- `LINUXDO_CREDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `LINUXDO_CREDIT_MERCHANT_PRIVATE_KEY`

The merchant private key signs official LDC order creation requests. The backend accepts Ed25519
private material as base64/base64url/hex seed or PKCS#8 DER/PEM.

Callback and browser URLs:

- `LINUXDO_CREDIT_NOTIFY_URL` should normally point to
  `https://<your-host>/api/linuxdo-credit/notify` and must be reachable by Linux.do Credit.
- `LINUXDO_CREDIT_RETURN_URL` should normally point back to the user console, such as
  `https://<your-host>/console/dashboard`.
- `LINUXDO_CREDIT_SUBMIT_URL` defaults to the official Linux.do Credit LDC submit endpoint and
  usually does not need to be changed.

After the process starts with valid payment credentials, open admin system settings and turn on
**Enable recharge**. Keep **Allow non-admin recharge** off while testing the payment flow with an
admin session; turn it on only when regular users should see the recharge card and create orders.
When **Enable recharge** is off, the user console hides recharge and the backend rejects new order
creation while still accepting already-paid callbacks.

For sandbox checks, `LINUXDO_CREDIT_TEST_PRICE_ENABLED=true` exposes a test offer where `1 LDC` buys
`1` monthly credit. Keep it disabled for normal paid operation.

## Which token should clients use

This distinction matters:

- admin endpoints use the admin access model, not Hikari tokens
- `/api/tavily/*` uses Hikari tokens
- `/mcp` also uses Hikari tokens

The Hikari token format is:

```text
th-<id>-<secret>
```

That is the token you should hand to:

- Cherry Studio
- scripts
- custom backends
- MCP clients

Do not hand raw Tavily API keys to those downstream consumers.

## Less common but supported advanced settings

Most deployments do not need these immediately, but they are part of the supported runtime
contract:

| Flag / Env                     | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `XRAY_BINARY`                  | Xray binary path for share-link based forward proxies                       |
| `XRAY_RUNTIME_DIR`             | Xray runtime directory                                                      |
| `API_KEY_IP_GEO_ORIGIN`        | origin for API key registration IP geo lookup                               |
| `ADMIN_MODE_NAME`              | override the displayed admin-mode name                                      |
| `FORWARD_AUTH_NICKNAME_HEADER` | display nickname passed through the gateway                                 |
| `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD`  | legacy plaintext built-in admin password, still supported but not preferred |

If your goal is local development, straightforward self-hosting, or a standard gateway deployment,
you usually do not need these first.

## One-page decision summary

If you only want the shortest correct answer:

- local development: `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true`
- single-instance self-hosting:
  `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_ENABLED=true` + `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
- gateway integration:
  `ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=true` + `FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER` + `FORWARD_AUTH_ADMIN_VALUE`
- end-user web login: additionally enable `LINUXDO_OAUTH_ENABLED=true`
- user recharge payments: additionally enable `LINUXDO_CREDIT_ENABLED=true` and configure the
  Linux.do Credit credentials + notify URL
- downstream client access: always use `th-<id>-<secret>`, never raw Tavily API keys
