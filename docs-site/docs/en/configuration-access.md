# Configuration & Access

This page is not just an environment-variable list. It answers three practical questions:

1. which settings are the minimum for this deployment
2. how admins are supposed to get in
3. which token downstream clients should actually use

## Start by choosing an access model

Tavily Hikari has two different access layers:

- admin access: who may enter `/admin` and call admin endpoints such as `/api/keys`
- user / client access: who may call `/mcp` or `/api/tavily/*`

Recommended defaults:

- local development: `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true`
- self-hosted single instance: built-in admin login
- production gateway: ForwardAuth
- end-user sign-in: Linux DO OAuth only when needed

## Core runtime settings

No matter which access model you choose, these settings are the main runtime contract:

| Flag / Env                        | Usually matters | Purpose                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `--upstream` / `TAVILY_UPSTREAM`  | yes             | Tavily MCP upstream URL         |
| `TAVILY_USAGE_BASE`               | yes             | Tavily HTTP / usage base URL    |
| `--bind` / `PROXY_BIND`           | yes             | listen address                  |
| `--port` / `PROXY_PORT`           | yes             | listen port                     |
| `--db-path` / `PROXY_DB_PATH`     | yes             | SQLite database path            |
| `--static-dir` / `WEB_STATIC_DIR` | depends         | frontend static asset directory |
| `--keys` / `TAVILY_API_KEYS`      | optional        | one-time key bootstrap helper   |

Notes:

- `TAVILY_UPSTREAM` has a default and usually does not need to be overridden in local development,
  but you should override it when using a mock, sandbox, or custom upstream.
- `TAVILY_USAGE_BASE` defaults to `https://api.tavily.com` and affects usage / quota sync flows.
- `WEB_STATIC_DIR` is optional. If omitted, the app will try to use `web/dist` when that directory
  exists.
- `TAVILY_API_KEYS` is convenient for bootstrapping, but long-term key lifecycle should be managed
  through the admin UI or admin API.

## Minimum config by deployment shape

### Local development

This is the shortest path:

```bash
export DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true
export PROXY_BIND=127.0.0.1
export PROXY_PORT=58087
```

That gives you:

- direct access to admin endpoints
- a quick path to inject the first upstream Tavily key
- local fallback behavior for `/mcp` and `/api/tavily/*` while validating the app

Use this only for local development.

### Self-hosted single instance

If there is no dedicated gateway, the simplest stable setup is the built-in admin login:

```bash
export ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_ENABLED=true
export ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH='<phc-string>'
export ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=false
```

This is the minimum reliable self-hosted setup. The admin signs in through the browser, receives an
HttpOnly cookie session, and then uses `/admin` and the admin API from there.

### Production gateway / zero-trust edge

If you already have a trusted reverse proxy or identity gateway, use ForwardAuth:

```bash
export ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=true
export FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER=Remote-Email
export FORWARD_AUTH_ADMIN_VALUE=admin@example.com
export FORWARD_AUTH_NICKNAME_HEADER=Remote-Name
```

In that model, admin status is derived from the trusted identity header, not from a local cookie.

## Admin access models

### ForwardAuth

This is the recommended production model.

There are only three things that really matter:

1. which header identifies the caller: `FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER`
2. which value is treated as admin: `FORWARD_AUTH_ADMIN_VALUE`
3. whether the reverse proxy actually injects that value into the request

The most common misunderstanding is this:

- `ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=true` is the default
- but if `FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER` is not configured, that does not magically create admin access

In other words, “the switch is on” does not mean “ForwardAuth integration is complete”.

### Built-in admin login

The built-in admin login is a good fit for:

- self-hosted single-instance deployments
- internal deployments
- setups that do not yet have a dedicated ForwardAuth or SSO layer

Required rule:

- once `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_ENABLED=true`
- you must provide either `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD` or `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH`

Recommended rule:

- prefer `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
- avoid keeping `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD` around long-term

Generate a hash like this:

```bash
echo -n 'change-me' | cargo run --quiet --bin admin_password_hash
```

### `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN`

This is the development shortcut:

```bash
export DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true
```

It does two things:

- opens admin access for local validation
- allows local fallback behavior for `/mcp` and `/api/tavily/*` when you are still wiring up the
  real auth path

Do not treat it as a production-grade access model.

## Linux DO OAuth

Linux DO OAuth is only for end-user sign-in. It is not an admin-auth mechanism.

Enable it when you want end users to log in through the web UI and automatically reuse their bound
Hikari token:

```bash
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_ENABLED=true
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID='<client-id>'
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='<client-secret>'
export LINUXDO_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL='https://<your-host>/auth/linuxdo/callback'
```

Those three values are required together:

- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL`

Other OAuth settings already have defaults and only matter when you need to override provider
endpoints:

- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_USERINFO_URL`
- `LINUXDO_OAUTH_SCOPE`

Session tuning is also available:

- `USER_SESSION_MAX_AGE_SECS`
- `OAUTH_LOGIN_STATE_TTL_SECS`

If Linux DO OAuth stays disabled, admins can still issue tokens manually for downstream clients.

## Which token should clients use

This distinction matters:

- admin endpoints use the admin access model, not Hikari tokens
- `/api/tavily/*` uses Hikari tokens
- `/mcp` also uses Hikari tokens

The Hikari token format is:

```text
th-<id>-<secret>
```

That is the token you should hand to:

- Cherry Studio
- scripts
- custom backends
- MCP clients

Do not hand raw Tavily API keys to those downstream consumers.

## Less common but supported advanced settings

Most deployments do not need these immediately, but they are part of the supported runtime
contract:

| Flag / Env                     | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `XRAY_BINARY`                  | Xray binary path for share-link based forward proxies                       |
| `XRAY_RUNTIME_DIR`             | Xray runtime directory                                                      |
| `API_KEY_IP_GEO_ORIGIN`        | origin for API key registration IP geo lookup                               |
| `ADMIN_MODE_NAME`              | override the displayed admin-mode name                                      |
| `FORWARD_AUTH_NICKNAME_HEADER` | display nickname passed through the gateway                                 |
| `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD`  | legacy plaintext built-in admin password, still supported but not preferred |

If your goal is local development, straightforward self-hosting, or a standard gateway deployment,
you usually do not need these first.

## One-page decision summary

If you only want the shortest correct answer:

- local development: `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true`
- single-instance self-hosting:
  `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_ENABLED=true` + `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
- gateway integration:
  `ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=true` + `FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER` + `FORWARD_AUTH_ADMIN_VALUE`
- end-user web login: additionally enable `LINUXDO_OAUTH_ENABLED=true`
- downstream client access: always use `th-<id>-<secret>`, never raw Tavily API keys
