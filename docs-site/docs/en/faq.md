# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## FAQ

### How is Tavily Hikari related to Tavily itself

Tavily Hikari is not a replacement for Tavily. It is the proxy and control layer you run in front
of your own Tavily keys.

It is responsible for:

- serving both `/mcp` and `/api/tavily/*`
- issuing Hikari-owned `th-<id>-<secret>` tokens to downstream users
- routing, auditing, and quota control across multiple upstream Tavily keys

The real Tavily API keys still belong to you and remain under admin control.

### What is the difference between a Hikari token and a Tavily API key

- Hikari token: handed to end users, scripts, HTTP clients, or MCP clients
- Tavily API key: stays in admin-only storage and is only used on upstream requests

If you want key-pool routing, request auditing, and quota enforcement, point clients at Tavily
Hikari instead of exposing raw Tavily keys directly.

### When should I use `/mcp` versus `/api/tavily/*`

- `/mcp`: for Codex CLI, Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, and other MCP clients
- `/api/tavily/*`: for Cherry Studio, scripts, and plain HTTP integrations

If the client setup only asks for a `Base URL + API key`, it usually belongs on `/api/tavily/*`.

### Do I have to use ForwardAuth

No, but you do need at least one admin access strategy.

- ForwardAuth: recommended for production
- built-in admin login: good for self-hosted single-instance setups
- `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true`: only for local or temporary debugging

Without one of those strategies, the service may boot, but you will not have a stable way to
manage upstream keys.

### Do I have to enable Linux DO OAuth

No.

Linux DO OAuth is mainly for end-user sign-in and automatic Hikari token binding. If the service is
admin-operated only, or tokens are provisioned manually, you can leave it disabled.

### Where is the state stored

Long-lived state is stored in SQLite.

- Flag / Env: `--db-path` / `PROXY_DB_PATH`
- default container path: `/srv/app/data/tavily_proxy.db`

That database usually carries key state, token bindings, request audit data, and other operational
records, so persistence should be part of your deployment plan.

### What is the difference between the docs site and Storybook

- docs-site: operator and integrator documentation
- Storybook: UI review surface for page states, dialogs, tables, and admin flows

Use the docs site to deploy or integrate the product. Use Storybook to inspect the interface.

## Troubleshooting

### `/admin` does not open, or `/api/keys` returns 401

That usually means the admin access model is incomplete.

Check in this order:

1. If you use ForwardAuth, make sure:
   - `ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=true`
   - `FORWARD_AUTH_HEADER` and `FORWARD_AUTH_ADMIN_VALUE` are configured
   - your reverse proxy is actually injecting the matching admin header value
2. If you use the built-in admin login, make sure:
   - `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_ENABLED=true`
   - `ADMIN_AUTH_BUILTIN_PASSWORD_HASH` is configured
   - `ADMIN_AUTH_FORWARD_ENABLED=false` when ForwardAuth is not in use
3. If this is only local validation, you can temporarily use `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true`

One more important detail: the repository root `docker-compose.yml` only starts Hikari itself. It
does not automatically configure admin access.

### `/api/tavily/*` returns 401 Unauthorized

First verify that the token is being passed in a Hikari-compatible way:

- preferred: `Authorization: Bearer th-<id>-<secret>`
- for `POST /api/tavily/*` JSON requests, the token may also be sent as `api_key` in the body
- for `GET /api/tavily/usage` and `GET /api/tavily/research/:request_id`, use the
  `Authorization` header

If you are relying on `DEV_OPEN_ADMIN=true`, remember that this is only a local development
fallback, not a normal integration path.

### `/api/tavily/*` returns 429 Too Many Requests

That usually means either:

- the Hikari token hit its hourly request cap
- the token ran out of quota

Check the user dashboard or call `GET /api/tavily/usage` first. Then adjust quota, tags, or issue a
new token if needed.

### `/api/tavily/*` returns 502 Bad Gateway

The two most common causes are:

- there is no usable upstream Tavily key
- Hikari cannot reach the upstream endpoint

Check:

- whether the admin surface shows at least one active key
- whether `TAVILY_UPSTREAM` and related upstream settings are correct
- whether you are pointing at the intended mock, sandbox, or production upstream

### Keys, tokens, or request logs disappear after restart

This is usually a persistence issue, not an application logic issue.

Make sure:

- `PROXY_DB_PATH` points into a persistent volume or host-mounted directory
- upgrades and container re-creation still reuse the same SQLite file

If you use the default container path, persist at least `/srv/app/data`.

### `docker compose up -d` works, but there is no admin entry on the homepage

That is expected behavior, not a bug.

The repository root `docker-compose.yml` only starts Hikari. It does not automatically enable:

- ForwardAuth
- built-in admin login
- Linux DO OAuth

If you want to operate the service from that compose stack, add an admin access model on top. The
shortest path is documented in [Deployment & Anonymity](/deployment-anonymity).

### Local Storybook or docs links open the wrong thing or fail

Local cross-links assume both local review services are running:

- Storybook: `http://127.0.0.1:56006`
- docs-site: `http://127.0.0.1:56007`

If only one of them is running, local cross-links can fail. The final GitHub Pages deployment does
not depend on those local ports.

### How do I inspect which headers were stripped in high-anonymity mode

Look at the request-audit fields:

- `forwarded_headers`
- `dropped_headers`
