# Tavily Hikari Docs

Tavily Hikari is a Rust + Axum proxy for Tavily traffic. It rotates multiple upstream keys, keeps
full SQLite-backed audit logs, supports admin and end-user access flows, and ships with a React +
Vite operator console.

It is not just a reverse proxy. Tavily Hikari packages Tavily access into four stable surfaces:

- Protocol entrypoints: it serves both `/mcp` and `/api/tavily/*`, so it can sit in front of MCP
  clients and plain Tavily HTTP API clients.
- Access-token layer: end users receive Hikari-issued `th-<id>-<secret>` tokens instead of seeing
  raw Tavily API keys.
- Operator and auth layer: admins can manage keys through ForwardAuth or the built-in admin login,
  while end users can sign in with Linux DO OAuth and reuse their bound token.
- Audit and quota layer: SQLite persists key state, request logs, and quota-related records for
  troubleshooting, accounting, and operational review.

Treat this site as the public operator guide: get the service running, choose an access model,
integrate clients, then review UI states when needed.

## What problems it solves

- One service fronting both Tavily MCP and Tavily HTTP API traffic.
- Multi-key scheduling with short-lived affinity, global least-recently-used balancing, and
  automatic handling for `432 exhausted`.
- Secret isolation: clients use Hikari tokens while raw Tavily keys stay admin-only.
- Operability: user console, admin console, Storybook review surface, and full request audit data.
- Deployability: local dev, Docker, Docker Compose, ForwardAuth gateways, and high-anonymity
  topologies are all first-class use cases.

## Documentation map

1. Start with [Quick Start](/quick-start) when you want a running instance fast.
2. Open [Configuration & Access](/configuration-access) for environment variables, admin login, and
   access patterns.
3. Use [HTTP API Guide](/http-api-guide) when integrating Cherry Studio or other HTTP clients.
4. Read [Deployment & Anonymity](/deployment-anonymity) for production, proxying, and
   high-anonymity notes.
5. Open [FAQ & Troubleshooting](/faq) when you need answers for 401, 429, 502, persistence, or
   admin-access problems.
6. Visit [Storybook](/storybook.html) for UI review instead of prose.

## What you will find in this project

- MCP proxying for clients such as Codex CLI, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code.
- HTTP API proxying for clients such as Cherry Studio that speak Tavily over REST instead of MCP.
- User-facing flows for login, token lookup, recent request inspection, and quota visibility.
- Admin-facing flows for key registration, recovery, disablement, secret reveal, and audit review.
- Documentation and review surfaces where the docs site explains usage and Storybook verifies UI
  states and component behavior.
